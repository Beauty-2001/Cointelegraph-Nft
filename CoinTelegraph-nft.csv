Bitcoin ordinals — also known as Bitcoin NFTs — have made their way into the limelight of the Web3 space, as more marketplaces continue to adopt and offer digital assets.

On May 9, the cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced that it will support Bitcoin ordinals on its NFT marketplace in late May. The development will expand Binance’s multichain NFT ecosystem to include the Bitcoin network.

Previously the Binance NFT market integrated with other decentralized networks, including BNB Chain, Ethereum and Polygon.

Mayur Kamat, the head of product at Binance, commented on broadening the offerings in the marketplace and Bitcoin’s

“Bitcoin is the OG of crypto.”

The update allows Binance users to purchase and trade Bitcoin ordinals from existing Binance accounts. According to the announcement, the update will also include royalty support and “additional revenue generating opportunities” for those creating Bitcoin ordinals.

Prior to Binance’s announcement, the cryptocurrency exchange OKX similarly announced in late April that it was bringing Bitcoin ordinals to its marketplace and wallet ecosystem. Initially, OKX users could view and store ordinals using their accounts, with the option to mint ordinals being hinted at in the future, according to Haider Rafique, the chief marketing officer at OKX.

The Bitcoin NFTs are also available on marketplaces such as Magic Eden, which integrated the feature back in March.

According to recent data, inscriptions of Bitcoin ordinals have been on the rise in recent months. On April 2, Bitcoin ordinals reached 58,179 inscriptions — up 83.5% from the previous month. However, on May 1, the total number of Bitcoin ordinal inscriptions skyrocketed to exceed 3 million.

Nonetheless, they remain a controversial topic within the crypto community, with Bitcoin maximalists criticizing them for deviating from Bitcoin’s original peer-to-peer ethos.

After a turbulent month for the crypto industry in March, Bitcoin’s 

BTC

$27,794

 price went sideways in April despite some volatility. The meteoric rise of memecoins, such as PEPE, made headlines, and First Republic, another mid-sized United States bank, went under. However, on the basis of current market sentiment is a standoff between markets and policymakers: While the U.S. Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell publicly states that interest rates are unlikely to come down this year, the markets for risk-on assets like crypto have firmly priced in a pivot in the coming months.

In times like these, it is wise to drill deeper into the fundamentals that will shape future market movements. With an uncertain macro environment and a looming regulatory crackdown in the U.S., there are other notable developments that are easily drowned out by these dominant news items.

The report is available for free on the Cointelegraph Research Terminal.

For those keen to gain a deeper understanding of the crypto space’s various sectors, Cointelegraph Research publishes a monthly Investors Insights Report that dives into venture capital, derivatives, decentralized finance (DeFi), regulation and much more. Compiled by leading experts on these various topics, the monthly reports are an invaluable tool to quickly get a sense of the current state of the blockchain industry.

NFT hype fades as memecoins take over

Nonfungible token (NFT) collectibles are one of the few sectors that took a major hit this month. Memecoins, such as PEPE, may be partially responsible for this, as they absorbed the attention, printing eye-watering gains. BRC-20 tokens, a new abstraction created on the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol, may also compete for cash inflow from traditional NFT collectibles traders. Sellers have started to persistently outnumber buyers on NFT marketplaces recently, and this trend is likely to continue.

There are concerns about the NFT market going into free fall, as all important metrics, such as volume and active wallets, have been on a steep decline. NonFungible reported only 49,200 active wallets and a sales volume of $80,500 this month. The NFT marketplace wars, combined with diminishing excitement around NFTs, are other driving factors behind this long-term development.

Despite the overall NFT market slump, a niche NFT sector that is picking up steam is the NFT lending market. Since the start of 2022, this sector has witnessed double-digit growth every month, and this continued in April with a 16.13% increase in new users.

Mining stocks outperform BTC

Every Cointelegraph Research Monthly Trends Report includes coverage of mining economics and crypto stocks. For investors interested in increasing their exposure to BTC, mining stocks have historically been a popular option. While idiosyncratic factors have negatively impacted individual stocks this month, the sector as a whole seems to have exited from the 2022 bear market.

The highest returns were again recorded by TeraWulf, which continued its rally with another 85% rise in evaluation. CleanSpark, IrisEnergy and BitDigital were other strong gainers. Notably, the stocks in April outperformed BTC on aggregate after lagging behind in the previous month. Where Bitcoin only posted a 2.8% close, the largest crypto stocks, dominated by mining, recorded 12.9%

Of course, increased evaluations in the mining industry are highly sensitive to BTC’s price action. For those with confidence in improving macroeconomic conditions for risk-on assets, these stocks may offer good entries as they were previously battered by the bear market. The stocks section of the monthly report tracks the fundamentals of major companies in the industry and thus amends our regular analysis of Bitcoin mining economics.

The rise of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) spearheaded a new era of digital ownership and investment. With a record number of new NFT collections launched in 2022, the NFT market capped $50 billion in sales volume for the first time. As a fast-growing market operating entirely in the digital world, however, it didn’t take long for the NFT industry to become a haven for fraudsters.

A recent report unveiled that in 2022, more than half of the NFT activity on the Ethereum blockchain, the most popular network for NFT trades, was fraudulent. From wash trading to copycat collections, the NFT market entered 2023 with a set of critical issues that could only be solved by advanced market intelligence and analytics. Assessing a fair price for an NFT is already tricky, as tremendous gaps between the floor price and the price ceiling are not uncommon for collections. On top of that, malicious market activity only adds more confusion to users’ NFT investment or trade decisions.

While NFTs from popular collections such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) hold immense value in the market, it’s relatively easy to copy the visual appearance of apes depicted in the collection as image files and then create fake NFTs based on copycat material. The $1.53 billion sales volume of the BAYC collection in 2022 presents a lucrative market for fake NFTs as well.

The impact of counterfeit NFTs

Fake NFTs created by copying the image of original art can be difficult to detect in the digital environment, resulting in significant financial losses for buyers. The impact of fake tokens in the NFT market includes economic, legal and reputational consequences. Investors who lose confidence in the ecosystem due to fake NFTs are less likely to return to the market. Without significant demand, the prices of NFTs are bound to drop.

Without proper tools, NFT collectors can quickly get confused trying to find an authentic NFT on the marketplace and trace its history. Luckily, recent tech developments in artificial intelligence (AI) now allow for the prevention of NFT buyers from investing in fake content. NFT analytics provider bitsCrunch recently launched an AI-powered tool that checks major blockchains and marketplaces for potential copycat or forged NFTs.

Fake NFTs caught by AI

By analyzing over 800,000 assets on the top NFT marketplace OpenSea against the top-40 NFT collections on the Ethereum blockchain, bitsCrunch found out that 144 copycat NFTs are exact visual matches to the BAYC collection. Moreover, 231 NFTs were flagged as near-exact matches, while “extremely similar” copies are as high as 814.

The fake NFT issue is hardly exclusive to BAYC. Other trending collections, including Azuki, Otherdeed and CloneX, have tens of exact copies detected by AI-powered analytics. bitsCrunch detects forged material across blockchain networks and flags newly-minted and existing counterfeit NFTs by analyzing real-time data.

AI-powered price estimation for NFTs

Confusion across the NFT market also arises when users want to put a fair price tag on an NFT they aim to sell, as floor price — the lowest-priced item listed for a specific collection — rarely gives a reliable perspective.

Many factors, including trading volume and history, last traded price and the profile of previous buyers, come into account when deciding the final price of a digital collectible. However, AI can now aid buyers and sellers in the form of the NFT Price Estimation tool by bitsCrunch. Aiming to accurately determine the true value of NFTs, the Price Estimation tool uses analyzed historical info and metadata for an NFT combined with the social media hype around the collection to provide more accurate price estimates.

The AI-driven machine learning tool has studied over 30 million NFTs from more than 2,200 collections to apply advanced data and analytics, benefiting the user when making buying or selling decisions.

The full potential of the NFT space can only be unlocked via tools that fight against issues like wash trading and forgery plaguing the market for the last couple of years. Users need AI-powered advanced analytics and intelligence presented on easy-to-understand screens to benefit from market data.

bitsCrunch offers accurate NFT analytics and forensics with UnleashNFTs to supply users with reliable insights into the market. The platform provides in-depth analysis, research and statistics about the NFT ecosystem, helping buyers and sellers to make better decisions with each NFT trade.

Additionally, as part of its commitment to bring more awareness and data transparency to the NFT ecosystem, bitsCrunch has launched its startup program. Companies working with NFTs can join this initiative to get quick access to bitsCrunch tools for analyzing and managing risk via API. Equipped with AI-powered analytics, NFT creators, traders and businesses can detect and avoid malicious activities while making transactions, thus expanding the NFT ecosystem in a healthier direction.

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

The decentralized finance (DeFi) space has been in correction mode, its current TVL of $50 billion representing less than a third of its peak in late 2021. The good news is that the market is preparing for another wave of DeFi adoption, primarily thanks to liquid staking tokens (LSTs), which have become the second-largest DeFi sector after decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether 

ETH

$1,854

 stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

With the Shanghai upgrade already live since mid-April, we can see a gold rush of LST adoption, with the DeFi community embracing LSTs for their ability to be the “internet bond” and provide a native form of yield. This can lead to DeFi protocols racing to get ahead by integrating LSTs. The sooner that DeFi protocols integrate LSTs, the greater the chance to secure a better place in the upcoming DeFi race, as the Shanghai update is expected to boost demand for staking services that also provide yield opportunities.

This liquid staking protocol addresses main obstacles in LST space

Even before the impact of the Shapella upgrade becomes evident, liquid staking protocols are popular due to their unique functionality. Nevertheless, many of them deal with a range of pain points that impact user satisfaction. One of the challenges is the complexity of token models, which can create confusion for users who may struggle to understand the mechanics and implications of their investments. This complexity can stem from the varying tokenomics, reward structures, and risk profiles of different protocols, making it difficult for users to navigate the ecosystem and make informed decisions.

Another major issue is poor user experience, which can be attributed to the lack of user-friendly interfaces, inadequate documentation, and insufficient support services.

High fees are also a concern in some liquid staking protocols, as they can significantly eat into staking yields and reduce the overall attractiveness of liquid staking.

One of the few liquid staking protocols that is working to address these challenges is Swell, which lets users stake ETH and receive swETH to start earning rewards in DeFi. While there are many liquid staking options, Swell aims to fix all the issues and compile the best offerings into a user-friendly experience. Swell focuses on simplicity, enabling ETH stakers to seamlessly dive into the journey of DeFi through its noncustodial decentralized application (DApp).

Source: Swell

Besides an improved user experience, Swell is reducing fees to unlock more rewards for users. As a rule, the fee rate for staking ranges from 10% to 25%, and may go even higher. With Swell, users can expect no protocol fees for a limited period.

Swell is also putting a great emphasis on security, especially as the DeFi market has been plagued by hacking attacks and scams. The protocol is audited by high-profile blockchain security services including Sigma Prime.

Swell can help DeFi projects, including lending protocols, DEXs and yield farming services, attract more users and secure a continual growth of the sector’s TVL. Meanwhile, individual stakers can start earning rewards without any deposit barriers.

With the DeFi race driven by liquid staking gaining traction, Swell will contribute to the next DeFi transformation by helping DeFi protocols grow their communities while offering stakers the best yield opportunities.

Blue chip nonfungible token (NFT) project Pudgy Penguins has signed a representation deal with major Hollywood talent agency William Morris Endeavor (WME).

According to an announcement via Twitter on May 5, Pudgy Penguins is looking to spread its intellectual property across film, Television and gaming.

Pudgy Penguins joins a growing list of big-name NFT projects that have sought out Hollywood representation deals as a way to expand their brands and audiences. WME’s other NFT-related clients include Dapper Labs co-founder Mack Flavelle, the Boss Beauties project, pseudonymous NFT artist FEWOCiOUS and artist Claire Silver.

Pudgy Penguins is the twenty-first highest-selling NFT project of all time, according to data from CryptoSlam. Since launching in July 2021, it has generated $250.2 million worth of sales on secondary markets.

Last month the project was acquired by Luca Netz of Netz Capital for 750 Ether 

ETH

$1,854

, worth about $2.5 million at the time of purchase on April 3.

Pudgy Penguins has been gradually developing a Web3 ecosystem and community surrounding the project and has already made some moves to get the intellectual property out into the mainstream.

In late March, the project soft-launched physical Pudgy Penguin figurines with certificates of authenticity and proof of ownership recorded on Ethereum.

Bitblox to build Web3 gambling games

New blockchain gaming studio Bitblox has launched to build a suite of Web3 gambling games on the Solana-based Hxro Network: a distributed liquidity layer for derivatives trading and betting applications.

The online gambling industry was worth roughly $63.5 billion in 2022 and is estimated to grow 11.7% annually from 2023 to 2030, according to Grand View Research.

In a May 4 announcement, Bitblox Games stated it would focus on developing player-to-player games built around skill and speed, where players bet against each other instead of the “house,” like in a casino.

“Blockchain-based gaming provides additional transparency to igaming operators while giving players the ability to bet in new and engaging ways,” said Bitblox CEO Brandt Page.

Specific games are yet to be announced; however, more information is likely to come later this month, with Bitblox set to debut at CasinoBeats Summit 2023 in Malta between May 23 and May 25.

Generative art via Unreal Engine

NFT infrastructure and ecosystem developer Palm NFT Studio has launched a new tool via Epic Games’ Unreal Engine, enabling creators to make generative “game-ready” 3D assets and art collections.

The tool is dubbed the “Palm Generative Art Maker.” It provides a simplified process for people to make generative art and assets, which is usually quite complicated for creators not well-versed in coding.

The tool was launched on May 4 and is available for download as an Unreal Engine plug-in.

It enables users to develop a concept in the plug-in and then port the assets into Unreal Engine 5.1 to fine-tune and add finishing details. From there, they can mint the assets as NFTs on the blockchain.

Interest in generative art has surged alongside the growth of the NFT sector over the past couple of years, with profile picture and avatar-based projects like CryptoPunks helping to popularize the method. At the same time, NFT art projects such as Tyler Hobb’s Fidenza have also driven interest in the computer-based art style.

Digital Star Wars toys on Flow

NFT startup Cryptoys has unveiled the upcoming launch of Star Wars digital collectibles on the Flow blockchain, home to major NFT projects such as NBA Top Shot.

The NFT collectibles, or “digital toys,” will drop on May 24, with the artwork bearing a similar design to Funko Pop figurines. Each token will be priced at $39.99 a piece in a randomized “blind box,” with the buyer not knowing which character they got until after purchase.

The NFTs will feature characters such as Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia. They will come in different tiers of rarity ranging from common to rare, legendary, “Grail” and “Ultra Grail.”

Other Nifty News

Kenya’s lawmakers are considering introducing a 3% tax on crypto and NFT transfers and a 15% tax on monetized online content, according to a new bill introduced on May 4.

The former OpenSea manager accused of insider trading of NFTs was convicted on May 3 of wire fraud and money laundering in a New York federal court.

Eligible Celsius users can withdraw all ‘Distributable Custody Assets’ following court approval

Certain Celsius users, largely those who only ever held funds in custody accounts, had previously been limited to withdrawing up to 94% of their funds.

Crypto lending platform Celsius has reported that certain users will be able to take out 100% of their original funds more than 300 days after the platform froze withdrawals.

In a May 4 announcement, Celsius said eligible users would be able to withdraw the remaining 6% of distributable custody assets from the platform following court approval. Until January, the same users, largely those who only ever held funds in custody accounts, had been limited to withdrawing up to 94% of their funds.

Earlier this year, the Court approved the distribution of the remaining 6% of Eligible Users’ Distributable Custody Assets (pure custody and transferred custody below $7,575 at the time of transfer) for a total of 100% of Eligible Users’ Distributable Custody Assets.

— Celsius (@CelsiusNetwork) May 4, 2023

The announcement marked progress in getting some Celsius customers reimbursed for missing funds for the first time since the company froze withdrawals in June 2022 before filin for bankruptcy in July. Many Celsius users reported a backlog of withdrawal attempts despite the funds supposedly being available, with some claiming requests had taken a matter of days to process.

According to court filings, Celsius was looking to combine its United Kingdom and United States entities, seemingly to have the two treated the same in bankruptcy proceedings. Celsius founder and former CEO Alex Mashinsky is also facing a lawsuit filed by the New York Attorney General’s office in January. Mashinsky filed a motion to dismiss on May 2, claiming the AG’s case “parrots misinformation.”

April saw several hacks, exploits and rug pulls that resulted in a net loss of over $100 million among several DeFi protocols.

Amid the growing memecoin frenzy, the chances of exploits have increased multifold, with WallStreetBets — a popular trading sub-Reddit group — allegedly rugging its users for $635,000 just days after airdropping about $15,000.

DeFi protocol Level Finance was a victim of an exploit resulting in the loss of nearly $1 million. The attacker manipulated a “claim multiple” bug in a Level Finance smart contract to steal more than 214,000 native Level Finance (LVL) tokens from the exchange.

The volume of liquid staking protocols has dramatically risen in the past couple of weeks, overtaking decentralized exchanges (DEXs). From April 13 to May 1, the total value locked (TVL) on decentralized exchanges declined by $1.66 billion, while it increased on liquid staking protocols by $280 million.

Liquid staking solutions now have more TVL than DEXs: DefiLlama

Liquid staking solutions like Lido and Rocket Pool now have a higher total value locked than DEXs, making them the top category of DeFi protocols according to data from the crypto analytics platform DefiLlama.

Liquid staking protocols have just recently taken the top spot. On April 13, $17.19 billion of crypto was locked in liquid staking contracts, compared with $18.89 billion in DEXs, according to archived information. However, DEXs have experienced a $1.66 billion decline to $17.2 billion, while liquid staking solutions have experienced a $280 million increase to $17.47 billion.

Crypto exploits, exit scams and flash loan attacks did not let up in April, with more than $103 million of funds stolen from crypto projects and investors. On April 30, crypto security and auditing firm CertiK posted an April roundup of crypto exploits, scams and hacks, revealing total funds lost was $103.7 million, bringing total year-to-date losses to $429.7 million.

The month was marred with significant crypto exploits, with $25.4 million lost due to an exploit of several maximal extractable value trading bots on April 3, $22 million stolen in a hot wallet exploit at the Bitrue exchange, and the $13 million hack of South Korean GDAC exchange.

WallStreetBets mod dumps memecoin worth $635,000 in alleged rug pull

A moderator of the popular trading subreddit r/WallStreetBets has dumped a large portion of WSB Coin (WSB), a token project claiming to be the official memecoin of Wall Street Bets.

On May 2, WSB was launched by people involved in moderating the WallStreetBets Reddit forum. The subreddit gained notoriety for the GameStop short squeeze, which sent hedge funds to their knees in January 2021. The creators of the WSB token claimed that there would be no allocation for the team and that 10% of the coins would be reserved for the subreddit.

Artists face a choice with AI: Adapt or become obsolete

Art generated by artificial intelligence is making waves because of its ramifications — for originality, authorship and authenticity.

The artificial intelligence art gold rush began around 2018 when Christie’s auctioned “Portrait of Edmond Belamy” for an astounding $432,500. Since then, it has been an up-only journey for AI-generated images.

“Théâtre D’opéra Spatial,” Jason Allen’s AI artwork, even won a prize at the Colorado State Fair art competition. This shows how AI-generated images have not only become more popular but also very sophisticated recently. But not everyone is happy about this development, and their concerns are valid.

The evolution of AI art has sparked feisty debates around originality, authorship and authenticity — themes fundamental to artistic expression. Generative AI, like any other technology, is intent-neutral. Whether the outcome is good or bad depends on how we use it.

So, it’s crucial to understand how and to what extent AI influences artistic communities and their creations.

The fears: Replacement, mimicry and homogenization

Some people fear that artificial intelligence will make artists obsolete — just like digital printing technology replaced analog typesetters, block makers, etc. This view, however, represents a limited, narrow perspective. Only the hopelessly conservative critic can peddle such short-sighted notions.

That’s not to say every traditional process involved in artistic creation will remain intact post-AI. Some of the menial and repetitive tasks will fade away. Yet, there’s little or no threat to creativity and ideation, the core humane aspects of art.

Nevertheless, AI-generated images do present some ethical problems, such as copyright violations. They stem from the methods companies use to train text-to-art models and general adversarial networks. Consequently, some artists recently sued Midjourney, Stability AI and DeviantArt for using their artworks in AI training without permission or compensation.

Abandoning such practices is necessary to ensure the long-term adoption of and trust in AI art. They raise concerns about mimicry and homogenization, especially as text-to-image tools become more popular and accessible. And ultimately, this defeats the purpose of enhancing artistic creativity using AI.

Regardless of how artists and creators feel about AI-generated art, generative art tools have cemented their spot in the art ecosystem. Artist communities can now either adapt or complain. Many artists have smartly resorted to the former.

Recognize AI art as a distinct form

Boris Eldagsen, a German artist and photographer, refused to accept the prize he won at the 2023 Sony World Photography Awards. He “applied as a cheeky monkey” and submitted an AI-generated image for the creative open category.

Eldagsen wanted to make a point about whether we should consider AI-based imagery photography. He thinks AI-generated images and photographs are different entities, and can’t compete in the same category. The same argument can apply to AI art in general.

Like painting, sculpting, sketching, etc., AI art is a category in itself. We must approach it that way. It’s not a question of regulating how artists use AI or if they can participate in competitions, nor is it about purely philosophical considerations seeking the essence of art. Instead, it’s necessary to recognize AI art as a distinct form, setting the parameters for judgment accordingly.

Having said that, adding identifying marks to distinguish AI-generated images from photography or other kinds of digital imagery may prove helpful — particularly in the early days, to curb misunderstandings and the potential spread of misinformation.

The segregation works both ways, though, and can stop people from confusing digital illustrations as AI-generated artwork. This helps avoid situations where creators get banned from channels with “no AI art” policies, like how digital artist Ben Moran was banned from Reddit’s r/Art subreddit.

Toward human-machine collaboration in art

The World Photography Organization said it awarded Eldagsen at the 2023 Sony World Photography Awards because the AI-generated work relied heavily upon the artist’s “wealth of photographic knowledge.” Moreover, the competition’s creative open category “welcomes various experimental approaches to image making from cyanotypes and rayographs to cutting-edge digital practices.”

This points to the fact that AI can enhance, not necessarily hamper, artistic creation. So, here’s the most critical aspect of AI’s influence on art and artistic communities: It widens their horizon significantly, unlocking new possibilities and ways to express ideas.

Accessible generative AI tools — such as Midjourney, Dall-E and my own BlueWillow — also foster artistic inclusion. They allow anyone with a creative mind to make high-quality digital artwork. Imagine a physically challenged person or someone unable to afford art supplies exploring their artistic capabilities with these tools. This wouldn’t perhaps be possible earlier, at least not easily.

AI-generated images also help professional artists work faster and more efficiently. The impact is similar to using assistive tools like Photoshop or Illustrator, but much greater. While working on a commissioned project, for example, they can easily create multiple mockups using text-to-image tools. This saves loads of time and effort, letting creatives focus on creativity and innovation.

Leverage technology — don’t fight it

Technological progress is inevitable. It’s also desirable if done right, while misplaced opposition is both naive and destructive. We are currently at this juncture when it comes to AI art.

Portrait artists decried the rise of photography. They were afraid. But today, we can only be thankful for the wonders that innovations in photography — both technology and content — have helped us achieve. Something similar will happen as we leverage AI for art.

AI’s disruptive influence is already visible to progressive artistic communities worldwide. Coupled with other emerging technologies like nonfungible tokens (NFTs), it’s enabling them to produce work with previously unimaginable variations, scale and speed. And we are thus witnessing the unfolding of our artistic future — one that’s diverse, community-oriented and technologically supreme.

Talking about nonfungible tokens (NFTs) in the music industry usually means protecting artists’ copyrights and diversifying their revenue streams, preserving artworks on the blockchain, musicians collaborating with brands and artists, printing event tickets, giving exclusive bonuses to fans in this unique digital format or engaging with a community. So, why not do what the sports industry has done (and quite successfully so) with the NFT memorabilia format?

The sports memorabilia market reached $2.6 billion in 2022 and is expected to hit $227.2 billion in 10 years. The collectibles include sports trading cards, video clips of popular moments in the history of sports, autographs, accessories, and many other things that can be in both physical and digital formats. The same can be said for music memorabilia with rare vintage photos that already exist, sometimes only in unknown archives that are hard to access.

Unique classic rock history moments

This was the case with Legends of Rock, which was acquired by Globe Entertainment and Media back in 2020. The collection, which had been owned by British photo agencies and archives for decades, was then shipped to Las Vegas. Packed in standard postal containers, it looked unlikely to contain anything of high value or importance.

It was a total surprise for Klaus Moeller, CEO of Globe Entertainment and Media, to find some 8 million vintage, never-before-seen photos of the biggest rock stars — Queen, Deep Purple, Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Frank Zappa, The Police, Bruce Springsteen, Nirvana, The Who and many more. The pictures were taken on stage and during other official moments, but also backstage in a more relaxed atmosphere. The photos were made between the 1960s and the early 1980s, with some artists already in the spotlight and others just beginning their prolific careers. “It’s never-ending. Every day we’re finding the craziest stuff,” said Moeller about the archive.

To make the collection accessible worldwide, Globe Entertainment and Media partnered with MADworld, an innovative Web3 and digital asset ecosystem backed by Animoca Brands.

Moeller said:

“We could not have found a better partner than MADworld to introduce these unique, pivotal moments from music history to a new generation of fans. This collaboration is helping us breathe new life to these legends of music’s past by onboarding them onto Web3.”

Along with the physical slides, a professional-quality, high-resolution digital image of the original slides is provided to the buyer as a digital Certificate of Authenticity (COA) NFT. This helps prove ownership and guarantees authenticity. In addition, in the event of a future secondary sale, it allows the buyer to conveniently and securely transfer ownership.

Phillip Tran, chief marketing officer of MADworld, said:

“We are thrilled to be part of this exciting project. A global audience of music lovers, collectors and investors will now be able to use a secure, digital COA to verify each slide’s provenance through blockchain technology to simplify the authentication process and protect collectors from forgeries.”

One of the most critical issues in the Web3 space that needs to be resolved as soon as possible is the blockchain trilemma in addressing decentralization, security, and scalability. Only then can this industry achieve mainstream adoption.

To solve this trilemma, the industry needs talent. However, attracting and retaining top professionals is the biggest pain point and bottleneck for every Web3 startup and DAO project. To keep the innovation engine humming, the Web3 industry needs to take a closer look at the available gallant tools to get professionals on board.

The Web3 talent pool offers a diverse range of expertise with a focus on multitasking and remote working, a new study revealed. The research, titled “Web3 Talent Survey,” is conducted by Intropia — a community-driven Web3 talent ecosystem. To understand and explore the attitudes and preferences of professionals looking into the Web3 space, Intropia surveyed over 6,000 respondents during the second half of 2022.

According to the research, a typical Web3 contributor — a term Intropia uses to broadly define talent working in the Web3 space — is between 25 and 44 years old and has been working professionally for more than five years. Fitting to the decentralized nature of Web3, community-related skills top the list as the most common primary skill set for Web3 contributors (16%). This is followed by skills focused on research (10%), engineering (9%) and product (7%).

Freelancers and part-time contributors lead the way when it comes to defining roles in the Web3 ecosystem, according to the report. One-fifth of respondents have full-time roles in decentralized anonymous organizations (DAOs), while 15% act as founding members in a DAO.

The ever-expanding universe of crypto and Web3 requires a knack for learning in order to keep up with the innovations and new trends introduced to the space on an almost monthly basis. So, it’s not surprising that the vast majority of Web3 contributors have a higher education and spend 8 to 32 hours each week on self-education. Those who learn also want to educate their network by teaching and mentoring others, the report emphasizes. Web3 professionals read articles and papers, attend courses or simply watch in-depth videos on YouTube to stay ahead of the curve.

What are professionals looking for in Web3?

The decentralized structure of the Web3 space is again reflected in the fact that the majority of respondents work on more than one project. More than 80% of respondents in the Intropia survey are working on multiple projects at once, which has become an industry standard. This also translates to the average weekly work hours of Web3 contributors. The report states that every third respondent works more than 32 hours per week.

When it comes to the types of projects, Web3 professionals are looking for opportunities in layer-1 networks such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Avalanche blockchains, layer-2 solutions like Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism, and decentralized apps (DApps).

“Web3 is like a club, with smart, like-minded individuals who are working toward a common goal,” the report summarizes, noting that more than half of the respondents (over 57%) rated their enjoyment of working in the Web3 space at 10 out of 10. The main concerns that stood out were scam projects, the fear of missing out (FOMO), and the slow rate of adoption.

The report urges projects seeking to hire Web3 professionals to embrace the diversity of the ecosystem. Because word-of-mouth is strong in the Web3 space, the top talent primarily uses referrals as a way to find their next gig. With a deeper understanding of the available talent pool, the industry will move forward with the next wave of innovation.

Final thoughts

The Web3 space is a thriving ecosystem that is continuously evolving. With its decentralized structure, Web3 professionals are creating innovative solutions for some of the world's most pressing problems. The industry's growth and popularity are reflected in the increasing number of projects, the hours worked by contributors, and the overall satisfaction of working in the space.

As the industry continues to expand, it is essential to address the concerns of Web3 professionals, such as scam projects and the slow rate of adoption. By taking a proactive approach to these issues, the industry can ensure that talented individuals remain engaged and motivated to work in the Web3 space. It is also crucial for projects seeking to hire Web3 professionals to foster an inclusive and diverse working culture that values collaboration and innovation. With these steps, the Web3 space can continue to grow and push the boundaries of what is possible.

Consensus, the annual crypto and blockchain conference, attracted over 15,000 attendees, 220 sponsors and 410 speakers to its 2023 edition in Austin, Texas, despite recent regulatory struggles around cryptocurrency adoption in the United States. 

The turnout at Consensus 2023 demonstrated that U.S.-based companies and international organizations are still very much interested in implementing Web3 technology into their business models.

Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Custodia Bank — a Wyoming-based digital asset bank — told Cointelegraph that the conference attracted serious ecosystem participants, saying, “We’ve seen during crypto winters before where Consensus gets overrun with high time preference people and companies (for example, multiple Lambo’s parked out front of the New York Hilton in 2018), and in bust years the low-time preference people and companies just keep building. This year was the latter.”

Businesses discuss Web3 strategies

Several large organizations were present at Consensus 2023, with Mastercard, Google, Robinhood and Coinbase, among others, gathering to discuss their Web3 strategies.

James Tromans, head of Web3 at Google Cloud, told Cointelegraph about some blockchain-based initiatives the company has recently launched.

“At the end of last year, Google Cloud announced Blockchain Node Engine, which allows users and developers to run an Ethereum node without having to manage or support it themselves,” he said.

At Consensus, the firm announced that it had expanded support for the Blockchain Node Engine to Polygon proof-of-stake, in addition to Ethereum.

Tromans added that Google Cloud knows what Polygon has been doing in the zero-knowledge (ZK) space, noting that Polygon ZK Ethereum virtual machines (zkEVM) and Polygon supernets will benefit from the provision of Google Cloud’s infrastructure and developer tools.

Moreover, Tromans pointed out that Google Cloud’s startup program will help onboard companies interested in building on Web3 using existing Google Cloud products. “Polygon is an important part of this initiative, as they have provided a $3 million contribution from their venture fund to get this off the ground with us,” he said.

Global financial services giant Mastercard announced its “Mastercard Crypto Credential” solution during Consensus. Raj Dhamodharan, head of crypto and blockchain at Mastercard, stated during a fireside discussion at Consensus that he is “excited about the underlying potential of blockchain technology” due to its ability to store and move value seamlessly.

However, Dhamodharan explained that “this potential is not fully realized today,” so Mastercard has started working on several products like Mastercard Crypto Credential.

“I believe that once you have the right building blocks necessary for safety and simplicity, you can have more businesses building and relying on the basic utility of storing and moving value,” Dhamodharan said on stage.

Conversations continued at side events

While there were 10 dedicated stages for 285 panels during Consensus, many side events allowed important conversations to continue outside of the conference.

For example, zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs) were widely discussed at Consensus, but in-depth conversations around ZK-proofs took place at the “ZK360” event hosted by Mina Protocol. Evan Shapiro, CEO of the Mina Foundation and co-founder of the Mina Protocol, told Cointelegraph that the goal of ZK360 was for attendees to learn about the latest advancements in ZK-proofs and how these can be applied in the real world. “Web3 needs both privacy and verified computation. ZK-proofs provide both of those at a time when applications are needing these features to be more effective, decentralized and scalable,” he said.

Other layer-1 blockchain networks like Ripple and Algorand hosted side events, allowing Consensus attendees to better understand specific blockchain offerings while networking with community members. These events also presented an opportunity for non-Consensus attendees to learn about important topics within the Web3 sector. 

Lacking an international presence

While the turnout during Consensus 2023 was notable, some industry experts highlighted that the conference lacked an international presence.

Yat Siu, chairman of Animoca Brands — a venture capital company focused on blockchain-based games — told Cointelegraph that regions in Asia like Japan and Hong Kong are offering a progressive and welcoming regulatory environment for crypto adoption. He noted that most people he spoke with at Consensus seemed surprised or even skeptical at this. He said:

“I think that a larger presence of overseas participants would have helped allow Consensus participants to better understand the scope of excitement and opportunity that exists outside of the United States. I would love to see a stronger international presence at Consensus next year.”

Despite this, Siu said that Consensus 2023 was a well-attended, high-energy conference overall. “I was surprised at the level of deal-making activity that was taking place, even if the narrative was that the U.S. was negative on crypto,” he said.

Echoing Siu was Keith Grossman, president of enterprise at MoonPay. He told Cointelegraph that he was impressed to see so many executives from some of the largest companies in attendance at Consensus. “Deals were being discussed, and I believe we will look back at Consensus 2023 recognizing it represented a maturation in the industry as it relates to how Web3 technologies can be deployed in a meaningful manner for businesses and their customers.”

The former OpenSea manager who was accused of insider trading of NFTs has been convicted on May 3 of wire fraud and money laundering in a New York federal court, according to Reuters.

According to prosecutors, Nathaniel Chastain, a former product manager at OpenSea, was in charge of choosing which NFTs would be featured on the website’s nonfungible token marketplace.

After making these decisions, he frequently purchased these NFTs and then resold them after they had been featured, prosecutors said. He was charged with wire fraud and money laundering on June 1 in connection with these alleged transactions.

The trial began on April 24 and has been watched closely by lawyers specializing in crypto-related issues. Some legal experts have argued that the outcome of the case may affect whether NFTs are considered securities.

According to the May 3 report, defense attorney Daniel Filor argued in the trial’s closing statements that Chastain wasn’t guilty because he had never been told the information was supposed to be confidential, stating “Nobody told Nate that he couldn't use or share that information.""

By contrast, prosecuting attorney Allison Nichols argued that Chastain knew he was breaking the law. She claimed that he used anonymous OpenSea accounts to make the trades, implying that he was afraid of being caught.

“He hid what he was doing,” Nichols reportedly told the jury in her rebuttal. “He knew that he had violated OpenSea’s confidentiality agreement.”

It marks the first time a person has been slapped for using privileged knowledge to trade nonfungible tokens.

A former employee of Coinbase, Ishan Wahi, and his brother Nikhil were also charged with insider trading of cryptocurrencies in a separate case in July. In that case, Nikhil Wahi pleaded guilty on September 12.

Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis says we may have AGI ‘in the next few years’

The CEO of Google DeepMind says human-level AI could emerge before 2033 — an event that could radically alter how crypto trading bots and GPT-based tech functions.

Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind, recently predicted that artificial intelligence (AI) systems would reach human-level cognition somewhere between “the next few years” and “maybe within a decade.” 

Hassabis, who got his start in the gaming industry, co-founded Google DeepMind (formerly DeepMind Technologies), the company known for developing the AlphaGo AI system responsible for beating the world’s top human Go players.

In a recent interview conducted during The Wall Street Journal’s Future of Everything festival, Hassabis told interviewer Chris Mims he believes the arrival of machines with human-level cognition is imminent:

“The progress in the last few years has been pretty incredible. I don’t see any reason why that progress is going to slow down. I think it may even accelerate. So I think we could be just a few years, maybe within a decade away.”

These comments come just two weeks after internal restructuring led Google to announce the merging of “Google AI” and “DeepMind” into the aptly named “Google DeepMind.”

When asked to define “AGI” — artificial general intelligence — Hassabis responded: “human-level cognition.”

There currently exists no standardized definition, test or benchmark for AGI widely accepted by the science, technology, engineering and math community. Nor is there a unified scientific consensus on whether AGI is even possible.

Some notable figures such as Roger Penrose (Stephen Hawking’s long-time research partner) believe AGI can’t be achieved, while others think it could take decades or centuries for scientists and engineers to figure it out.

Among those who are bullish on AGI in the near term, or some similar form of human-level AI, are Elon Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

Don’t Look Up … but AGI instead of comet

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 1, 2023

AGI’s become a hot topic in the wake of the launch of ChatGPT and myriad similar AI products and services over the past few months. Often cited as a “holy grail” technology, experts predict human-level AI will disrupt every facet of life on Earth.

If human-level AI is ever achieved, it could disrupt various aspects of the crypto industry. In the cryptocurrency world, users could see fully autonomous machines capable of acting as entrepreneurs, C-suite executives, advisers and traders, with the intellectual reasoning capacity of a human and the ability to retain information and execute code like a computer system.

As to whether AGI agents would serve humankind as AI-powered tools or compete with humans for resources remains to be seen.

For his part, Hassabis didn't speculate on any scenarios, but he did tell The Wall Street Journal that he “would advocate developing these types of AGI technologies in a cautious manner using the scientific method, where you try and do very careful controlled experiments to understand what the underlying system does.”

This might stand in juxtaposition to the current landscape, where products such as his own employer's Google Bard and OpenAI’s ChatGPT were recently made available for public use.

Industry insiders such as OpenAI's Altman and DeepMind’s Nando de Freitas have stated that they believe AGI could emerge by itself if developers continue to scale current models. And one Google researcher recently parted ways with the company after claiming that a model named LaMDA had already become sentient.

Solving these scaling challenges is what will deliver AGI. Research focused on these problems, eg S4 for greater memory, is needed. Philosophy about symbols isn’t. Symbols are tools in the world and big nets have no issue creating them and manipulating them 2/n

— Nando de Freitas ️‍ (@NandoDF) May 14, 2022

Because of the uncertainty surrounding the development of these technologies and their potential impact on humankind, thousands of people, including Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, recently signed an open letter asking companies and individuals building related systems to pause development for six months so scientists can assess the potential for harm.

Bitcoin’s BRC-20 token standard has become the latest trend in the crypto ecosystem, especially after the Pepe (PEPE) memecoin rise in recent months. A total of 8,500 different tokens have been minted using the BRC-20 standard, with the majority of these BRC-20 tokens being memecoins, such as PEPE and Memetic (MEME).

BRC-20 is an experimental token standard on the Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,794

 blockchain modeled on Ethereum’s ERC-20. It allows programmers to create and send fungible tokens via the Ordinals protocol.

Although modeled after ERC-20, the BRC-20 token standard fundamentally differs from its Ethereum-based counterpart. BRC-20 tokens don’t make use of smart contracts. The token standard also requires a Bitcoin wallet to mint and trade these tokens.

The BRC-20 token standard was created early in March by an anonymous on-chain analyst called Domo. The objective was to make it possible for fungible tokens to be issued and transferred on the Bitcoin blockchain. The market cap of BRC-20 tokens has exploded over the past month and currently sits at $120 million, a 600% rise in the past week.

The BRC-20 token frenzy has also dwarfed the blockchain’s original number of Bitcoin transactions. The number of BRC-20 transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain between April 29 and May 2 reached over 50%, outperforming regular BTC transactions.

The BRC-20 token volume peaked on May 1 at 366,000 transactions, with the total number of transactions on the network being 2.36 million.

Along with the rise in BRC-20 transactions, transaction fees have surged due to the new token activity. Since its inception in late April, the network has generated an additional 109.7 BTC in transaction fees for miners.

The memecoin frenzy has been a notable topic on the Ethereum blockchain, but with the rise of the BRC-20 standard, a similar trend is also observed on the Bitcoin blockchain. The memecoin craze has also led to a significant rise in Ethereum network gas fees, contributing to network congestion.

Being stuck at home for almost two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, people around the world are eager to experience new cities, countries and cultures. The flexibility of working from home now allows travelers to plan around a less home-bound lifestyle. However, age-old problems, including delayed or canceled transportation, lost luggage and check-in mixups, continue to trouble the travel industry, which is expected to tap $850 billion in revenue by the end of 2023.

People rightly have high expectations for their travel experience, including low cost, better security, transparency and personalisation. These demands can be met with the help of peer-to-peer (P2P) connections, decentralized networks, fast transactions and interoperable systems that enable seamless data exchange.

That's why the travel industry needs blockchain solutions. The transparent, scalable and secure nature of blockchain technology can reduce costs, increase efficiency and foster collaboration to provide a more streamlined and personalised experience for travellers.

However, current blockchain networks fail to meet the needs of the highly-specialized nature of the travel industry, which works with fragmented processes across multiple stakeholders and where trust and regulatory compliance are crucial. A uniquely-designed blockchain is needed today to act as a layer 1 infrastructure to address the specific requirements of the travel industry.

Industry pioneers joined forces for efficiency

Seeing how blockchain can improve the current travel experience for all parties, industry pioneers, stakeholders and Web3 professionals come together to launch an inclusive blockchain ecosystem named Camino Network to pave the way for innovation in the multi-billion dollar industry. Supported by the travel giants like TUI, Lufthansa, Miles & More and Eurowings, Camino Network lays the groundwork for an entire ecosystem of Web3 travel apps and services.

Built on Avalanche’s technical base, Camino’s blockchain is tailored specifically for the travel ecosystem. The project leverages the next-generation capabilities of this technology to bring efficiency, security and innovation to the travel industry with the aim to provide better, more personalized experiences for travelers around the world.

Cutting down transaction costs by using blockchain helps with reducing fees for both businesses and users. A number of key players from the travel industry announced their backing for the Camino Network, with over 80 of them directly supporting the infrastructure by acting as initial validators of the blockchain.

NFTs and digital wallets for personalized travel experience

Despite being an essential need for travelers, updating hotel and accommodation info needs constant effort with legacy infrastructures. The information flow is bound by multiple bilateral contracts and interfaces, commonly resulting in outdated info for guests. Camino uses blockchain for more streamlined data management across all parties with nonfungible tokens (NFTs).

While NFTs are mainly known as digital collectibles in the Web3 space, the travel industry presents immense potential to go beyond one use case and introduce actual utility. Similarly, the travel industry can benefit from the flexibility and reliability of NFTs for many legs or a travel experience, making it an ideal match. With NFTs, it becomes possible to produce hotel or other key travel info as a unique digital token, where the info is stored in a decentralized manner. The crucial info NFT contains can be automatically updated whenever new information becomes available, keeping the latest version of data for all parties involved. With better management tools and systems developed for the Web3 era, the Camino Network enables all stakeholders in the industry to benefit from a secure and transparent ecosystem.

NFTs can also help with the tokenization of assets of inventory, potentially bringing a new marketplace where everything about the travel experience can be sold and exchanged for a much wider range of personalization. An NFT can act as digital ownership proof for travel-related assets, from flight tickets to hotel rooms and loyalty points, introducing a new level of reliability to the industry by solving fraud and payment risks. It also takes the stress out of last-minute decisions, a common headache for both customers and airlines, by making it easy to resell any tickets for both customers and airlines. Camino Network can serve as the basis for an NFT-based voucher platform to remove manual and lengthy processes from redeeming travel coupons with smart contracts. With a broad range of use cases, NFTs will provide new revenue streams and pave the way for new business models within the travel industry.

The next chapter of travel is taking off

To provide a safe and secure environment for Web3 developers, over 200,000 lines of code written for the Camino blockchain were audited by prominent cybersecurity service provider Hexens. The team also launched a hacker bounty hunt for the Camino Network to prove its reliability.

Web3 developers and travel companies who aim to transform the industry have already started working on the Camino Network for a wide range of decentralized apps. The Camino Network invites everyone — both from the travel industry and the Web3 space — to join hands to prepare an age-old industry for the next generation of travelers.

Combining ordinals with ZK technology: The future of ‘smart’ Bitcoin?

Using ordinals and zero-knowledge technology can make Bitcoin transactions simpler, but also form an important step toward a ‘smart’ Bitcoin.

The rise of ordinals on Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,794

 has opened many doors for developers and users. By permanently inscribing data on the Bitcoin blockchain, digital objects like art can have verifiable ownership. However, not only digital art objects can benefit from this development. Domain addresses are also possible using this technology.

Untangling public wallet keys

Sending and receiving transactions over the blockchain has many advantages. Some of these include the verifiability of transactions and the immutability of the blockchain. Thanks to the blockchain, digital value can be transacted in perpetuity, like a person handing over a physical dollar bill to someone else.

However, using the technology is not so simple for everyone. Users need a certain amount of knowledge about how blockchain and their wallets work, and they also need to know how to securely send crypto to a wallet.

One of the difficulties users might experience is that public keys can be quite intimidating. They are long strings of seemingly random numbers and letters. One mistake and the crypto is either lost or ends up in the wrong wallet. And with the immutability of the blockchain, there is no way to get it back.

Where there is a need, developers get to work. One of the popular projects that aim to make crypto transactions more user-friendly is Ethereum Name Service (ENS). This platform turns these complicated wallet addresses on Ethereum into easily readable domain names, just like any website.

For a long time, however, it was impossible to integrate a comparable solution for the Bitcoin network.

A step toward ‘smart’ Bitcoin

This all changes with BTCDomain. The platform uses ordinals and zk-STARKs, short for “zero-knowledge Succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge,” to generate unique domain addresses that can be used on the Bitcoin network. But how does it work under the hood?

In essence, ordinals are unique inscriptions in transactions on the Bitcoin network. In this way, ordinals are verifiable using a blockchain explorer. BTCDomain uses this approach to associate Bitcoin domain addresses. The platform contains all the necessary metadata within a Bitcoin transaction. When a user sends BTC to one of the registered domains, for example, “satoshi.btc,” the platform resolves the underlying public key so that the BTC ends up at the correct address.

To ensure that this happens correctly, users should be able to trust that the system is resolving the transaction correctly. This is where the zk-STARK technology comes in.

One of the options is for users to run a full Bitcoin node in combination with an ordinal database on their own machine. While this is possible, it requires some technical skills and time. BTCDomain solves this problem by resolving a transaction using the resources of the platform. It inspects each Bitcoin transaction and generates a zero-knowledge proof. Users can then confirm that the domain address holds the underlying public key they are sending BTC to.

What’s more, with the latest Miami update, BTCDomain now allows users to inscribe their own website on the Bitcoin network. Thanks to the update the platform can automatically resolve domain names to the dedicated web2 website. For example, if a user owns ordinal.btc and builds an html file and inscribes it on the Bitcoin network, BTCdomain can automatically show this website on ordinal.btc.page.

Criticism against ordinals

However, the use of ordinals on Bitcoin has drawn criticism. Due to its growing popularity, the network’s activity increased significantly. In turn, this led to higher transaction fees, leading critics to oppose the use of the Bitcoin network for anything other than financial transactions. Founder of BTCDomain Jay Lee is a firm believer that it is everyone’s own choice what they do with Bitcoin: “Everyone could always use Bitcoin as a financial transaction chain. We (who believe in ‘smart’ Bitcoin) don’t affect any original use of Bitcoin. Someone might argue ordinals have pushed transaction fees higher. But we are in a free market. Whoever pays the highest gas fee rate gets included in a block. It is fair.”

According to Lee, BTCDomain brings “smart Bitcoin” closer by showing developers that it is possible to build trustless applications that rely only on Bitcoin. This could lead to a thriving decentralized finance sector built on the Bitcoin blockchain in the future.

As part of the new platform, SI Tickets and ConsenSys are partnering to develop a ""Super Ticket"" that allows hosts to remain connected to their attendees through highlights, collectibles, exclusive offers and loyalty benefits via NFT technology. ""Blockchain is the future of ticketing,"" SI Tickets CEO David Lane said.

""From the moment we launched our global event marketplace, which now boasts 50 million tickets to over 250,000 sports, concerts and shows, we have been preparing to enter and disrupt the primary ticket market.""

Through Super Ticket, attendees can scan their NFTs for expedited entry passes, drink coupons and music downloads before the event and can receive post-event video content and rewards thereafter. ""Guests will keep their tickets to your event in their digital wallet forever,"" the new website tells event organizers.

Launched in June 2021, SI Tickets has grown to over $2.5 billion in marketplace inventory. The platform claims to charge zero transaction fees on any purchase and guarantees a 100% refund if an event is canceled for any reason. Box Office said it would charge $1.40 and 3% commission per ticket plus 3% merchant pass-through fees for event organizers.

According to data sourced from user @beetle from Dune Dashboard, nonfungible token (NFT) marketplace Blur has facilitated 8,820 Ether, or roughly $16.37 million, in loans through perpetual NFT lending protocol Blend one day after its launch. On May 1, Blur introduced Blend as a novel protocol for pledging NFTs for loans, which was developed in conjunction with venture capital firm Paradigm.

Together, the Azuki, Wrapped CryptoPunks and Milady NFT collections represent the largest collateral, with over 8,000 Ether

 worth in market value pledged. The top Blur lender, who has issued 58 loans worth 1,180 ETH, is Taiwanese celebrity Jeff Huang, also known as Machi Big Brother.

A prominent figure in Taiwan's music industry, Machi Big Brother is also an avid collector of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT series. Machi was one of the biggest recipients of the Blur token airdrop in February and reportedly sold 1,010 NFTs within 48 hours on Feb. 25 in the ""largest NFT dump ever.""

There are 846 active loans on the platform at the time of publication, with eight refinancing events. As a perpetual lending protocol, Blend automatically extends the duration of loans at expiry, assuming neither the borrowing nor lending party objects. Loans can also be refinanced or held at Dutch auction in case of interest rate changes. Protocol developers claim that Blend charges neither borrowing nor lending fees, but only interest.

Last year, NFT lending protocols fell into disarray after a crypto bear market caused many collectibles to become illiquid, some of which had no bids at all. One protocol, BendDAO, had as little as $23,715 to pay back lenders at the time after facilitating more than 15,000 ETH in loans.

Udemy’s ""Global Workplace Learning Index"" for the first quarter of 2023 indicates that ChatGPT, financial services and courses aimed at developing students' business-teaching skills have experienced a massive uptick in interest from the site’s reported 49 million users.

This likely comes as no surprise, as the public is currently experiencing what Wired recently described as a “Wet Hot AI Chatbot Summer” coming on the heels of OpenAI’s launch of ChatGPT.

According to Udemy, topic consumption — the number of users taking courses featuring skills specific to one subject — has risen 4,419% for ChatGPT.

Other top tech skills receiving increased interest from students included Nutanix, Azure Machine Learning and Amazon Elastic MapReduce — all cloud-related courses with applications in the field of machine learning. Artificial intelligence (AI) art generation also showed an uptick in interest, as did illustration.

The report also summarizes the top three surging skills by popularity for 15 countries. Despite the increase in topic consumption, ChatGPT only managed to break into the top three for the U.S. market, where it sits at the top spot. AI topped the list in Argentina and came in second in Canada.

Also of note, manufacturing, government and financial services topped the list of surging industries, with related skills seeing outsized growth.

Beyond the tech industry, the report provides figures for skills in the “professional power skills” category. Leading the list is “teaching.” With a 764% increase in topic attention in Q1 2023, related skills were second only to ChatGPT in consumption. 

While the report doesn’t state any direct conclusions, it does include a quote from instructor Diego Davila, who said:

""Having a comprehensive understanding of ChatGPT and other emerging AI technologies will be imperative to quickly pivot in today’s era of rapid digital transformation.”

Chatbot technologies are already impacting the cryptocurrency world, with the advent of advanced trading bots capable of interfacing with third-party plugins built on ChatGPT and similar platforms becoming increasingly popular.

But the Udemy report also indicates that technologies underpinning blockchain development are seeing a rise in interest as well. Python certifications saw an uptick of 272% and FastAPI skills consumption increased by 102% — both are widely used in the development of blockchain tech.

Members of the community had varying reactions. Some believe that it’s a massive development for the space, while others called on the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to protect users against such products.

On May 1, Blur launched a peer-to-peer perpetual lending protocol called Blend, a platform it developed with the help of venture capital firm Paradigm. The protocol supports NFT collateral, and the team claims it would collect zero fees from lenders and borrowers.

A community member praised Blur’s new move, saying it’s “massive for the space” and makes things more efficient. They tweeted:

Meanwhile, another Twitter user thinks that the new development from the OpenSea competitor is a good distraction from the “overall negative sentiment” within the NFT space. The community member may be referring to the dwindling number of NFT buyers in April. According to data from the analytics platform NFTGo, sellers dominated the NFT market in the month.

While some focused on the positives, others disapproved of NFT lending. A community member highlighted the risk of being unable to pay the loan and losing much more money. Meanwhile, an NFT collector took the opportunity to give a lesson on NFTs.

Web3 lawyer Jesse Hynes tagged the SEC’s Twitter account and said that the commission should be protecting investors from this type of activity. According to Hynes, it’s “extremely dangerous.” 

Blur has been positioning itself within the NFT space, prompting moves from OpenSea in what the community informally refers to as the “NFT marketplace wars.” On Feb. 18, OpenSea implemented 0% fees to win back its users from Blur. OpenSea also recently launched an advanced NFT marketplace aggregator in another effort to rock the boat.

While many pre-existing NFT marketplaces already host peer-to-peer sales of digital artworks, the auction house is attempting to separate itself by offering a “rotating, curated selection of leading artists hand-picked by Sotheby’s specialists.”

All NFT sales on the Sotheby's Metaverse platform occur by way of smart contracts that allow digital art collectors to pay for their art and collectibles with the choice of Ether 

ETH

$1,854

 or Polygon 

MATIC

$0.8818

.

Sotheby’s also noted it would honor artist royalties through smart contracts on the secondary sales platform and will automatically pay artists according to the royalty rate they choose to select.

According to a Sotheby’s May 1 announcement on Twitter, the platform will launch featuring works from 13 prominent digital artists, including the pseudonymous artist XCOPY, Claire Silver, Tyler Hobbs and Hackatao.

The 279-year-old British-American clearing house made its first appearance on the NFT scene in April 2021, when it auctioned off the work of a pseudonymous digital artist known as Pak. Since then the art house has conducted a number of record-breaking digital art sales.

On June 11, 2021, Sotheby’s sold a rare CryptoPunk known as “Covid Alien” for a staggering $11.8 million.

Just three months later on Sept. 10, Sotheby’s facilitated an action of 101 Bored Ape NFTs that cleared a total of $24 million.

In November 2021 Sotheby’s conducted the largest NFT charity auction in history, auctioning off 140 rare NFTs to raise funds for the nonprofit healthcare organization Sostento.

Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) system capable of interpreting and reconstructing human thoughts. 

Advertisement
The basic building blocks of DeFi and NFTs in one place - the ABCs of Crypto Report by Cointelegraph Research

The scientists recently published a paper in Nature Neuroscience exploring using AI to non-invasively translate human thoughts into words in real time.

According to the researchers, current methods for decoding thoughts into words are either invasive — meaning they require surgical implantation — or limited in that they “can only identify stimuli from among a small set of words or phrases.”

The team at Austin circumvented these limitations by training a neural network to decode functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals from multiple areas of the human brain simultaneously.

In conducting this experiment, the researchers had several test subjects listen to hours of podcasts while an fMRI machine non-invasively recorded their brain activity. The resulting data was then used to train the system on a specific user’s thought patterns.

After the training, test subjects had their brain activity monitored again while listening to podcasts, watching short films and silently imagining telling a story. During this part of the experiment, the AI system was fed the subjects' fMRI data and decoded the signals into plain language in real time.

According to a press release from the University of Texas at Austin, the AI was able to get things right approximately 50% of the time. The results, however, aren’t exact — the researchers designed the AI to convey the general ideas being thought about, not the exact words being thought.

Fortunately for anyone concerned about having their thoughts infiltrated by AI against their will, the scientists are very clear that this isn’t currently a possibility.

The system only functions if it’s trained on a specific user’s brainwaves. This makes it useless for scanning individuals who haven’t spent hours providing fMRI data. And even if such data was generated without a user’s permission, the team ultimately concludes that both the decoding of the data and the machine’s ability to monitor thoughts in real time require active participation on the part of the person being scanned.

However, the researchers did note that this might not always be the case:

“[O]ur privacy analysis suggests that subject cooperation is currently required both to train and use the decoder. However, future developments might enable decoders to bypass these requirements. Moreover, even if decoder predictions are inaccurate without subject cooperation, they could be intentionally misinterpreted for malicious purposes.”

In related news, a team of researchers in Saudi Arabia recently developed a method for improving precision in diagnosing brain tumors by processing MRI scans through a blockchain-based neural network.

In their paper, the Saudi researchers demonstrate how processing cancer research on a secure, decentralized blockchain can improve precision and reduce human error.

Related: What is Immutable, explained

While both aforementioned experiments are cited as early work in their respective research papers, it’s worth noting that the technology used in each is widely available.

The AI underlining the experiments conducted by the team at the University of Texas at Austin is a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT), the same technology that ChatGPT, Bard and similar large language models are built on.

And the Saudi Arabian team’s cancer research was conducted using AI that was trained on Nvidia GTX 1080s, GPUs that have been available since 2016.

Realistically speaking, there’s nothing stopping a clever developer (with access to an fMRI machine) from combining the two ideas in order to develop an AI system that can read a person's thoughts and record them to the blockchain.

This could lead to a ""proof-of-thought"" paradigm, wherein perhaps people could mint nonfungible tokens (NFTs) of their thoughts or record immutable ledgers of their feelings and ideas for posterity, legal purposes or just bragging rights.

The impact, for example, of thought-to-blockchain NFT minting could have implications for copywriting and patent applications where the blockchain serves as proof of exactly when a thought or idea was recorded. It could also allow celebrity thinkers such as Nobel laureates or contemporary philosophers to codify their ideas in an immutable record — one that could be commoditized and served as collectible digital assets.

On May 1, nonfungible tokens (NFTs) marketplace Blur launched Blend, a peer-to-peer perpetual lending protocol that supports NFT collateral. Developed with venture capital firm Paradigm, developers cite Blend's rationale as a means of ""financialization to scale.""

Blend has neither oracle dependencies nor expiries, allowing borrowing positions to open indefinitely until terminated. Developers also claim that the protocol would collect zero fees from borrowers and lenders:

""Blend matches users who want to borrow against their nonfungible collateral with whatever lender is willing to offer the most competitive rate, using a sophisticated off-chain offer protocol.""

Per design, Blend automatically ""rolls a borrowing position for as long as some lender is willing to lend that amount against the collateral."" For this, no on-chain transactions are required unless one party decides to exit the position or there is a change in interest rate.

By using a perpetual lending protocol, borrowers and lenders extend the loan expiration time by a predetermined period by default. If a lender wishes to terminate the loan against the borrower's wishes, an interest-rate ""Dutch auction"" for refinancing is held when the borrower has not repaid the debt at expiration. The auction begins at 0% refinance interest with a steadily rising rate.

""In Blend, an NFT may be liquidated whenever a lender triggers a refinancing auction and nobody is willing to take over the debt at any interest rate.""

That said, developers explained that borrowers can repay the loan at any time on Blend. ""If a borrower wants to change the amount they have borrowed or get a better interest rate, they can atomically take out a new loan against the collateral and use the new principal to repay the old loan,"" they wrote.

Launched in the third quarter of 2022, Blur has rewarded users with ""care packages,"" redeemable for BLUR tokens since Feb. 14 to increase trading activity. The platform has since surpassed OpenSea in terms of trading volume.

 Ordinals — also known by some as Bitcoin NFTs — could renew developer enthusiasm for Bitcoin and boost mining fees, according to cryptocurrency investment firm Grayscale.

In an April 27 “Market Byte” blog post, the firm suggested that Ordinals provide two key benefits to the growth and development of the Bitcoin ecosystem.

The first is a substantial increase in fees paid to miners, which has been seen since the launch of the protocol in January, according to Grayscale.

“The advent of ordinals has led to an increase in total fees paid to miners [...] which could potentially establish a sustainable baseline level of transaction fees to incentivize miners.”

Grayscale argued that this would ensure “continued network security throughout the lifetime of the Bitcoin network.”

As reported by Cointelegraph, in less than two months after its launch, more than $600,000 was paid to Bitcoin miners, solely as the result of fees generated by Ordinal inscriptions. As of the time of publication, that figure now exceeds the $6.5 million mark.

The investment firm also believes that Ordinals and the “velocity of NFT adoption” could also attract new Bitcoin users and spark more development on the Bitcoin network. 

“We believe the emergence of ordinals is likely to promote a development-oriented community and culture in support of the Bitcoin network.”

On April 30, Ordinals reached a new record, with the number of daily inscriptions topping 300,000.

Around the same time, the number of Bitcoin transactions neared peaks not seen in a number of years, according to blockchain data firm IntoTheBlock.

The meteoric rise of Ordinals has been a controversial topic in the wider Bitcoin community, with Bitcoin maximalists extensively criticizing them for straying from the original purpose of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic currency and clogging up valuable block space.

One such critic is Blockstream CEO Adam Back, who has declared Ordinals to be “useless” and saythat he is “more into Bitcoin as a currency.”

While nonfungible tokens (NFTs) have been gaining traction since the start of the year, the hype element is now fading away. More digital artists and creators worldwide are using NFTs to monetize their work with minimal investment, transforming the digital art space. Nevertheless, the blurred lines between artistic expression, plagiarism and trademark infringement have caused legal challenges, as regulations around cryptocurrencies and digital collectibles aren’t cast in stone yet.

For example, the Hermes vs. Rothschild lawsuit addressed critical questions about trademark infringement and NFTs. In this case, the popular French luxury design house Hermes sued 28-year-old creator Mason Rothschild over his MetaBirkins collection, which included 100 NFTs featuring digital, fur-covered bags resembling Hermes’ iconic Birkin range. On Feb. 8, 2023, a nine-member jury reached a verdict in Hermes’ favor. The court found Rothschild liable for trademark infringement, trademark dilution and “cybersquatting,” awarding the company $133,000 in damages.

This legal battle underscored the importance of digital artists and big brands drawing clear lines between their work and trademarks to prevent a negative impact on both parties — at least until regulations are clarified. For users, explicit rules are of great importance, as they can prevent them from investing in scams and forgeries.

NFT analytics firm detects another case of IP infringement

In a potentially similar instance of IP infringement, NFT analytics firm bitsCrunch discovered that the popular NFT collection Coodles appears to incorporate the McDonald’s logo within an attribute labeled “McCoodles.” This particular attribute showcases the McDonald’s logo on hoodies in the collection. Out of 8,884 NFTs in the series, 434 of them feature the McDonald’s logo as an attribute.

Source: OpenSea

At the time of writing, these 434 NFTs have generated over $500,000 in total volume, and 398 different owners have these McDonald’s-themed NFTs. The collection has garnered 3,373 Ether 

ETH

$1,854

 in overall volume, with a floor price of 0.0059 ETH since its inception.

According to OpenSea’s description of the project, Coodles is a “community rewarding collectibles project of 8,888 randomly generated NFTs on Ethereum.”

In the recent Hermes vs. Rothschild case, the court stated that artists, critics and commentators’ rights do not extend to the point where they cause confusion among consumers regarding the origin of the content. So far, there is no public information about any collaboration or agreement between McDonald’s and Coodles.

As per Kantar, McDonald’s is the sixth most valuable global brand and the fifth one in the United States. The brand’s value surged 27% in 2022 to almost $200 billion.

The case is relevant to McDonald’s, as the company has been actively expanding into the Metaverse, filing multiple trademark applications to establish virtual restaurants last year.

As established by the Hermes IP infringement case, featuring a brand’s logo in an unrelated NFT collection could potentially mislead consumers and damage the brand’s reputation. Moreover, NFT purchasers receive limited rights, increasing the risk of unintentional copyright infringement.

Anyone can detect IP infringement in NFTs

In the Hermes vs. Rothschild case, NFT marketplaces OpenSea, Rarible and Zora agreed to delist the MetaBirkins collection. This means that the owners of these NFTs have limited exposure to secondary markets to sell their assets. To avoid similar situations, investors should monitor NFTs and check for any IP infringement before making a purchase.

BitsCrunch has been developing APIs that assist brands in determining if their logos have been utilized in NFT collections, thus helping them safeguard their intellectual property rights. Thanks to its NFT Forgery Detection API, the blockchain analytics firm identified the connection between the Coodles collection and the McDonald’s logo.

Source: bitsCrunch

Besides brands, this API allows anyone to track whether an NFT collection incorporates a brand name and, as a result, could be liable for IP infringement.

The AI-driven API can detect partially or completely counterfeit NFTs, fabricated logos and brand identities of well-known brands, as well as new or existing NFTs, to protect users from investing in potential scams and forgeries.

Guardians of the NFT ecosystem

In the blockchain space, NFTs have had the most widespread adoption in comparison to cryptocurrencies, which have had more than 10 years to get to where they are today. Like all innovations, this adoption brings both good and bad, like when online sellers market famous brand names and products in the Metaverse as virtual goods or NFTs without permission. With this new virtual marketplace comes new questions for brands: How do real-world intellectual property rights apply to products in the Metaverse? How can brands protect their intellectual property?

Although bitsCrunch can’t fully respond to these questions and completely prevent all shady projects, the team can fight them and do its best to help brands remove these counterfeit NFTs from the NFT marketplaces and enforce their rights.

Going forward, bitsCrunch plans to strengthen cooperation with governments and financial institutions in the fight against crypto fraud and wash trading, and actively support a wide range of users — from novices to professionals — in the NFT and blockchain space, detecting and eliminating fraudulent activity across the NFT ecosystem.

How can blockchain projects benefit from deploying their own DEX?

As the crypto industry relies on centralized exchanges, blockchain projects are exploring the benefits of DEX integration to regain control of their native tokens.

USE CASE
Join us on social networks

Cryptocurrency exchanges have been instrumental in the adoption of blockchain technology, but the industry has become too dependent on them. Today, the crypto industry is still geared toward exchanges and traders rather than blockchain projects and developers. There is too much friction for developers building projects on the app layer.

Getting listed on a major centralized exchange (CEX) is a six-figure expense, plus additional fees each month for a market maker to ensure liquidity. In 2018, a Business Insider investigation found that crypto exchanges charge between $50,000 and $1 million to list initial coin offerings (ICOs).

Even after those expenses, exchanges are the ones who profit from all the trading fees, which drains value from crypto projects and makes it hard to attract liquidity in a sustainable way.

Besides exorbitant listing fees, DApp builders lose control over the liquidity and value of their tokens by having to abide by the exchange’s policies and fees. In addition, listing on centralized exchanges can also lead to counterparty risk (not your keys, not your coins).

Regaining control over native tokens

One of the alternative approaches to attract liquidity is to turn to decentralized exchanges (DEXs), which have reduced counterparty risk and low fees due to the absence of intermediaries. This solution may give app builders more control over the liquidity of their tokens, reducing reliance on centralized exchanges and improving security. Moreover, using DEXs rather than CEXs allows blockchain applications to benefit from DEX features, including non-custodial trading, reduced security risks and lack of KYC obligations.

As beneficial as DEXs are, they do have some drawbacks. For example, they are limited by the transaction capacity of their networks. As volume increases, so do the fees for executing trades. This has become a major problem for DEXs, many of which are hosted on Ethereum and use an automated market maker (AMM) to manage their trading. In addition, DEXs aren't efficient enough to compete with CEXs (e.g., in terms of capital efficiency and liquidity levels). Lastly, DEXs prioritize generating revenue for their liquidity providers and token holders, not the projects who use them.

While using a DEX enables self-custody and permissionless settlement, they’re not efficient enough. DEXs still lack support for off-chain pricing models, where pricing is based on the total aggregate liquidity in the market (both on- and off-chain) as opposed to the liquidity that happens to be in a given AMM's smart contracts.

There is a friction point in the user experience as well. Visiting a third-party DEX forces users to leave the apps they love whenever they make a trade.

Shopify for DEXs

The solution might be to make DEXs as efficient as CEXs and give each project ownership of its own DEX. But how to do that? ​​The good news is there are specialized projects that provide such DEX-as-a-feature solutions, and one of them is Native. The project makes it easy for developers to deploy exchanges, integrated directly into their DApps, earning their own swap fees and accessing the liquidity across the network.

Native is a DEX infrastructure layer, or more simply, a toolkit for any other project to become its own DEX, cutting out the middlemen and reducing costs, much like Shopify allowed entrepreneurs to create their own e-commerce sites.

Native’s proprietary integrations with professional liquidity providers and market makers account for over 30% of daily crypto trading volume, giving teams a significant advantage over standalone DEXs. Best of all, it's completely free to use: projects set their own swap fees, which go to token issuers.

The technology behind Native matches CEX-level efficiency and is completely modular, meaning that teams can create any type of exchange they want, using any liquidity sources, pricing models and trading pairs they desire. Projects can work directly with professional liquidity providers and market makers in a permissionless way, on-chain, and get their own liquidity.

Liquidity is king

Liquidity can come from one of three sources: the project itself, the community, or external liquidity sources such as automated market makers (AMMs), aggregators, and professional liquidity providers. Native can leverage a wide range of liquidity resources thanks to its approach of using off-chain pricing and on-chain RFQs (requests for quotes), which lets any project use market makers and professional liquidity providers for on-chain liquidity.

By providing a decentralized infrastructure layer for DEXs, Native is taking a big step toward solving the liquidity and control issues facing blockchain projects. With its innovative approach and focus on empowering crypto entrepreneurs, Native is helping blockchain projects benefit from increased revenue and deeper liquidity. Meanwhile, DApp users can swap the native token directly in the app, enjoying a simpler and more frictionless experience.

Ricky Li from Nomad Capital, which lead the $2M seed round investment in Native’s seed round, said:

“Native empowers everyone to have their own DEX and control of liquidity and fees. The vision is that no builders or users should be held hostage by CEXs and centralized DEXs like Uni or Curve to facilitate liquidity. This really resonates with our belief that there is a missing financial infrastructure layer that enables us to scale and attract the next users. We need more DeFi middleware infrastructure projects like Native.”

To demonstrate how easy it is to use the technology, Native released 5minuteDEX, a fully-functional DEX with deep liquidity across all the top trading pairs.

Source: 5minuteDEX.com

Native launched its private beta in March of this year and opened up the platform to anyone in April in a permissionless manner.

By providing a DEX layer, Native enables teams to create their own DEXs, reduce costs and regain control over their native tokens. Thanks to this approach, Native has managed to secure strategic partnerships with many blockchain projects, including Ankr, NodeReal, Metaverse.ai, Augmentlabs.io, CyberConnect, QuestN, LightNet and Byte.City.

In Venezuela, humor plays an important role, either as a form of protest or a way to make sense of reality. 

In November 2021, humor and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) were combined with the launch of the Comedy Monsters Club (CMC) project. The project was led by Roberto Cardoso, better known by his former stage name “Bobby Comedia,” and co-founded with brothers José David Roa and David Roa.

The project was advertised as the only comedy club to use NFT collectibles as membership. However, the hype would quickly turn to confusion for the project’s investors.

An enticing narrative

Comedy Monsters reached the NFT-curious Latin American audience through the well-known Venezuelan comedians.

Cardoso and his co-founders appeared in publications like Forbes Mexico and on popular shows and comedy podcasts such as Nos Reiremos de Esto and Escuela de Nada.

Listenting to an episode of Escuela de Nada titled “How To Make Money With NFTs,” pseudonymous NFT collector Nairobi first came to learn about the presumptive comedy club. Later, they would decide to join the CMC community and purchase an NFT themselves.

“It’s in that conversation where you can really identify the project’s selling narrative,” Nairobi explained.

During the episode, the hosts interview Comedy Monsters co-founder José David, a self-appointed “NFT expert.” In the conversation, José David uses his own example of being an early investor in Bored Ape Yacht Club, reportedly earning over $300,000 from selling one of his NFTs.

“For someone who is new to the NFT ecosystem, this can lead to false expectations,” Nairobi said.

CMC officially launched in November 2021 with an offering of 10,100 NFTs. The starting price for each was 0.1 Ether 

ETH

$1,854

, worth between $400 and $500 at the time of the sale. The monsters wouldn’t be revealed to their owners until all the NFTs were sold.

Cardoso told Cointelegraph that the comedy club’s purpose was “to deliver as many experiential, material and economic benefits” to its members as possible.

However, beyond the novelty of the project’s proposal, it was never clear how CMC would maintain or increase the value of its NFTs. In a small section on its website consisting of only three sentences, the creators explain the tokenomics behind the project.

“The rarer it [the NFT] is, the better benefits it will possibly have and the greater value it will surely have,” it reads.

Community “failure”

The period after the initial launch of an NFT collection can be critical to determining the project’s success. The value of the tokens will depend on the public’s continued interest in investing, putting projects under pressure to implement successful marketing strategies.

The CMC founders were so concerned about the sale of their Monster NFTs that former members reported that the project’s creators pressured the community to help come up with sales strategies to sell them.

“We were practically demanded to come up with marketing strategies. There was also the alleged raffle of a Mutant Ape NFT within the community, under the condition that Comedy Monsters Club sold out in just 15 days,” Nairobi recalled.

The pressure on the community was stacked on top of another key point: An inadequate execution of the club’s roadmap.

The CMC roadmap had five stages: the production of a podcast, a comedy festival exclusive to holders, games and raffle prizes in ETH, a foundation and a United States branch.

Despite posts on social media showcasing 2022 as a successful year for CMC, its community shared a very different experience. The project launched a podcast, but stopped after less than 20 episodes. CMC founders organized events, but they weren’t exclusive, and there were limited tickets for NFT holders. Even the raffles ended up switching from ETH prizes to giving out CMC NFTs instead.

The project never reached its goal of a total sell-out. According to its smart contract, there are 2,320 holders, owning 7,660 monsters in total.

Cardoso said that a significant but unspecified number of NFTs were used in publicity stunts and giveaways, and he blamed the 2022 crypto market crash for the project’s failure to sell out.

A rough approximation of the comedy club’s earnings shows that it could have made as much as $2 million to $3 million, based on estimates of the value of the sold tokens at the time of CMC’s launch.

Today, the CMC smart contract shows a balance of 0 ETH, and there’s only a little over $300 in ETH left in the project’s main wallet.

A “soft rug-pull”

The community never knew for sure how the funds were spent on the project’s roadmap or how much was taken by Cardozo and the Roa brothers, making the case for a possible soft rug-pull.

Suspicion about the project’s trustworthiness arose in early March 2022 when holders began to complain about the founders’ neglect of the community.

According to the testimony of several former CMC holders, concerns began when David, the project’s appointed CEO, left the Discord group, followed shortly by his brother, José David. The community also reported that CMC holders who raised questions on Telegram chats were being blocked.

Cardoso told Cointelegraph that he actually signed a separation agreement with his former co-founders on Nov. 9, 2022, leaving him at the head of the project as founder and CEO. Specific details of this agreement remained private.

In November, CMC holders and community members also noted a lack of transparency surrounding the usage of funds.

One pseudonymous CMC holder, RAMXx, proceeded to track the project’s funds on the blockchain. The public record revealed that 411.9 ETH — valued at over $1.18 million using ETH’s average price between November 2021 and June 2022 — had been extracted from the project and swapped using different cryptocurrency exchanges.

Venezuelan Twitter user Victor Noguera also shared more information by showing his process tracking everything on the blockchain.

His research also found that the money had been divided between three wallets. The contract shows that two wallets received a share of 25% each while a third received 50%, which the community presumed were controlled by the Roa brothers and Cardoso, respectively.

Cardoso confirmed the wallet amounts to Cointelegraph: “All the income from the minting was divided into three wallets. Logically, my previous co-founders and I had access to these wallets to operate the club.”

With these findings, the community confirmed that the project lacked a community wallet, an instrument often used in Web3 communities to allow holders to keep track of invested funds and serving as a treasury for a project’s roadmap.

The lack of a community wallet came as a shock for some CMC NFT holders, whose investments’ floor price is now just 0.015 ETH, or less than $30.

Cardoso confirmed the community findings to Cointelegraph, stating that the Monster NFTs were solely “a membership for a club which includes a roadmap with benefits.”

“The resources or funds belong to those who sell the token, not to the community. There isn’t a social contract that says that the funds belong to the community or a ‘community’ wallet,” he explained.

The conversation about the irregularities of CMC reached social media by December 2022. A community moderator, Alfonzo González, recalled on a Twitter Space that the founders improvised a lot, which combined with a notable lack of transparency and unsustainable strategies to keep up with the roadmap.

The gray zone of NFTs

In today’s NFT industry, legal protections for users still remain unclear. As the Web3 space relies heavily on communities to create their own rules, users often get involved in projects with a lot of promise but little obligation to their participants.

This can be seen in the phrasing of goals and the clarification of deadlines — or lack thereof — in project roadmaps. If founders don’t provide accountability measures in case they fail to meet the project’s goals and the participants or holders do not demand them, it could result in losses for the community if the project fails.

The only visible promise the Comedy Monsters creators made to their community was a rough roadmap. The project lacked deadlines and specific consequences if it failed to meet its goals. The whole project was based on the utility of the NFTs — providing real-world benefits, including international comedy events and other experiences, like workshops.

According to Maria Londoño, a lawyer and co-founder of the NFT project Disrupt3rs, this ambiguity is what led to serious miscommunication between the founders and the community.

“They made very vague promises, and there were attempts to solidify them. However, there are neither specified, committed parties nor deadlines for the promises. There isn’t any contractual obligation that could be demanded,” she told Cointelegraph.

“Saying things like ‘This will probably go up in value’ could sound like a promise or return on investment through speculation, but it could also be plain ignorance,” Londoño added.

After the social media storm, Comedy Monsters Club continues to be active, offering events and workshops to their holders.

Cardoso said the project would continue despite the damage to the club’s image. “A part of it is to learn and improve,” he said.

Londoño also believes that, in the end, the creators of Comedy Monsters Club underestimated the importance of making explicit rules and expectations for themselves and their holders:

“I believe that both parties (creators and community) were wrong by not setting and demanding clear rules. The community lost money and the creators their reputation. It’s a lose-lose situation due to lack of understanding that the rules of the traditional world still apply in Web3.”

The neobank Cogni has announced that it is rolling out soulbound nonfungible tokens containing Know Your Customer (KYC) information to holders of its crypto wallet. The Polygon-based NFT will transfer customers’ “Web2” KYC verification done by the bank at account opening into a Web3 environment.

Cogni, which has United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation coverage through a traditional New York bank, introduced its noncustodial multichain crypto wallet in January. Users can send, receive and hold cryptocurrencies and NFTs in the wallet. Users can optionally mint the nontransferable soulbound NFT, which decentralized apps (DApps) can then decrypt with the owner’s permission.

The bank’s intention is to create an improved user experience. Cogni founder and CEO Archie Ravishankar told Cointelegraph:

“The reason why the crypto-curious have not really been able to jump on the decentralization bandwagon is, one, obviously, the user experience. The second is trust in the ecosystem.”

“Everybody knows how to use digital banking,” however, Ravishankar added. The crypto wallet is available “in the course of the normal banking experience.”

The “bank-level” KYC information contained on the NFT satisfies KYC requirements in the United States and will be available to partnering DApps with no further action necessary. Cogni foresees creating a marketplace of DApps that can be connected to, including KYC verification, with only a few clicks.

The use of non-custodial wallets has been rising after the bankruptcies of major crypto firms during the crypto winter trapped customers’ money in their custodial wallets. The Cogni soulbound NFT will initially be available to select users and is expected to be open to the public in the summer.

Recent data has revealed that throughout April, the nonfungible token market has consistently seen more sellers than buyers, without a single exception.

According to data from the analytics platform NFTGo, there were only 7,907 buyers on April 26, while there were 8,641 attempting to sell their NFTs.

Days before, on April 19, the NFT market hit its second lowest point in the past twelve months, with only 5,893 buyers — a slight increase from the lowest recorded date in the past twelve months, which was on June 18, 2022, with 5,343 buyers.

On April 5, while there were more buyers on the market — 18,495 — there were also 36,423 sellers.

Based on the data, there hasn’t been a single day in April where the number of buyers outnumbered the number of sellers in the NFT market, indicating a potential lack of demand that could be concerning for thosplanning to sell their NFT soon.

The last recorded day buyers exceeded sellers was on March 11, when there were 9,756 buyers and 9,754 sellers.

The turbulent market conditions have been met with various community reactions on Twitter.

Ovie Faruq, the co-founder of Canary Labs, stated in a tweet on April 26 that the NFT market is “not functioning” at the moment.

Cointelegraph previously reported that the NFT market experienced a decline on March 12, after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank caused fear in traders.

Before the bank’s collapse, NFT trading volumes were hovering between $68 million to $74 million on March 10; however, on March 12, they fell to $36 million.

The dip was also accompanied by a 27.9% drop in daily NFT sales count between March 9 and March 11.

According to a March 20 CoinGecko report, the top six NFT marketplaces saw a rise in wash trading in February for the fourth month straight, with a total volume of $580 million.

The report revealed that the market witnessed a 126% increase from the previous month’s volume of $250 million — with the report attributing the overall recovery of the NFT marketplace as the reason for the increase.

Decentralized metaverse platform The Sandbox will partner with security solution provider Ledger Enterprise to develop security integration for its partners, who will get their nonfungible token collections migrated to the Ledger wallet.

The Sandbox announced the partnership in its official blog on April 23. The collaboration will include several initiatives. The Sandbox will appear as a DApp on Ledger Enterprise, and a certain widget will also be integrated in the Ledger Live desktop application. All NFTs in The Sandbox collection wallet will be transferred to the Ledger Enterprise wallet.

Apart from that, as the release emphasizes, The Sandbox will recommend Ledger Enterprise to its LAND owner ecosystem, while Ledger will promote The Sandbox metaverse to its clients. The initiative extends the recently established partnership between The Sandbox and Ledger to promote crypto education in the metaverse.

In 2022, companies have tried to work together for the first time, promoting crypto security education through a game, called School of Block, in The Sandbox’s Metaverse. According to the VP of communications at The Sandbox, Ariel Wengroff, the company was “thrilled” with this experience.

At the end of May, Ledger raised $109 million (100 million euros) in a Series C funding round extension, placing its valuation at $1.4 billion (1.3 billion euros). The capital, provided by such investors as VaynerFund, Cité Gestion SPV, True Global Ventures and Digital Finance Group, will be used to expand the company’s distribution network, increase production and develop new products.

The Sandbox also works actively on broadening its partnerships network. In February, the company signed a memorandum of understanding with the government of Saudi Arabia, pledging to “explore, advise and support” one another in metaverse development.

The Sandbox also previously partnered with some of the biggest names both inside and outside of the Web3 space, including Snoop Dogg, Gucci, Tim, Atari, HSBC and Warner Music Group.

 users will soon be able to interact with the network through an open-source plugin enabled on OpenAI’s artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, ChatGPT.

The plugin will allow ChatGPT to check wallet balances, transfer Solana-native tokens and purchase nonfungible tokens when OpenAI makes plugins available, according to an April 25 tweet by Solana Labs, the development firm behind the Solana blockchain.

Solana Labs is also encouraging developers to test using the open-source code to retrieve on-chain data that they may be interested in.

— Solana Labs (@solanalabs) April 25, 2023

The screenshot shared by Solana Labs shows that ChatGPT can retrieve a list of NFTs owned by a particular Solana address, which shares an attached metadata link to the NFT — presumably sourced from Solana Labs’ block explorer.

Solana Labs did not mention whether the plugin would be launched when OpenAI makes the plugin feature available to all.

The new ChatGPT plugins work by retrieving information from online sources and interacting with third-party websites to respond to commands requested by the user. The feature is currently being rolled out to all users.

However, not everyone is satisfied with the development.

One Twitter user asked Solana to firstly focus on developing a “working block explorer” while another questioned what benefit it would bring to the ecosystem.

It appears as though Solana Labs is now placing more focus on AI, having also announced on April 25 that it would provide $1 million in funding toward projects that build AI tools on Solana:

ChatGPT users can now delete chat history

On the same day, OpenAI announced ChatGPT users can now “turn off” their chat history, thanks to a new privacy feature.

The team announced the rollout of the new feature in an April 25 statement, which was launched to provide users with more control over their data. The firm added:

“Conversations that are started when chat history is disabled won’t be used to train and improve our models, and won’t appear in the history sidebar.”

The feature can be found in ChatGPT’s settings, which can be changed at any time, OpenAI said.

OpenAI explained that deleted conversations will be retained for 30 days for the purposes of reviewing them to monitor abusive material. Once that is cleared, conversations will be permanently deleted.

The AI firm also added in a new “export” option for users to download their data and make more sense of what information ChatGPT stores.

The new privacy feature comes as Italy recently became the first European country to ban ChatGPT until it complies with the European Union’s user privacy laws pursuant to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

A California court ruled Apple violated state competition laws by barring app developers from using alternative in-app payment methods apart from its own, which includes a 30% commission.

The decision may clear the path for cryptocurrency and nonfungible token (NFT) projects to add more functionality to their iOS apps.

The April 24 ruling was made by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in the case of Apple vs Epic Games — the creator of the video game Fortnite.

The court upheld the decision of a lower court from 2021 and said that Apple’s anti-steering provision harmed Epic.

The anti-steering provision is an Apple policy stating that iOS developers cannot communicate out-of-app payment methods through certain mechanisms such as in-app links.

The policy increased the costs of Epic’s subsidiaries’ apps that are still on Apple’s App Store and prevented other app users from becoming would-be Epic Games consumers, the court wrote.

Tim Sweeney, the founder and chief executive of Epic Games, tweeted on April 24 that the ruling “frees iOS developers” by allowing them to direct consumers to alternative payment solutions.

Fortunately, the court's positive decision rejecting Apple's anti-steering provisions frees iOS developers to send consumers to the web to do business with them directly there. We're working on next steps.

— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) April 24, 2023

While the court ruled in favor of Apple on most issues, the tech giant failed in its argument that the anti-steering provisions shouldn’t apply to Epic Games because it terminated Epic Games’ iOS developer account in August 2020.

The court ruled that Epic Games would have earned additional revenue since then — save for Apple’s policy — by applying the competitor-suit “tethering test” and the consumer-suit “balancing test” and found the anti-steering provision to be “unfair” pursuant to both tests.

The court looked at Apple’s anti-steering violation through a second angle, ruling that consumers would have flocked to Epic Games directly had they learned about its much lower commission rate of 12%, compared to Apple’s 30%.

“If consumers can learn about lower app prices, which are made possible by developers’ lower costs, and have the ability to substitute to the platform with those lower prices, they will do so — increasing the revenue that the Epic Games Store generates.”

If Apple doesn’t appeal the ruling, it could set a case law precedent benefiting creators of crypto and nonfungible token apps because they won’t be subject to Apple’s 30% “tax.”

Decentralized exchange Uniswap is one of the latest crypto projects to make its way into the App Store despite Apple initially withholding its launch in March.

Nearly two months ago, the European Union set new anti-monopolistic rules that require Apple to permit third-party app stores on its devices, which in turn allow consumers to circumvent Apple’s 30% commissions.

However, in December, Apple interfered with NFT transactions sent on Coinbase’s self-custody wallet, claiming that it’s entitled to “collect 30% of the gas fee” through in-app purchases.

Japan’s regulatory and political environment for crypto and Web3 technologies has been evolving rapidly over the past several years. The Financial Services Agency of Japan reported in December 2022 it planned to lift restrictions on foreign-issued stablecoins in Japanese exchanges, which could have significant implications for the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem in Japan and the wider region.

Furthermore, the Japanese government’s announcement that it plans to invest in nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and the metaverse highlights the increasing recognition of the potential of Web3 technologies to transform various sectors of society and the economy.

On the backdrop of these significant strides for blockchain and cryptocurrency, industry insiders from around the world gathered at the historic Kanda Myojin Shrine in Tokyo for DAO Tokyo 2023, a conference focused on decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and organized by Fracton Ventures.

The lineup of keynote speakers spanned various sectors of the DAO ecosystem, including ENS DAO, which manages the Ethereum Name Service; Shibuya, a decentralized social media platform; the dYdX Foundation, an independent foundation dedicated to decentralized exchange dYdX; and more.

Traditions meet decentralized tech

Speakers discussed the importance of DAOs as a new paradigm for organizational governance and decision-making and their potential to transform the art world, promote decentralized creativity and empower local businesses and residents.

DAO Tokyo featured numerous panel discussions where participants discussed the importance of creating decentralized systems that prioritize user privacy and control, and the potential for Web3 to enable new forms of value creation and monetization.

The panelists also discussed the potential of blockchain technology to enable new forms of trust and collaboration, particularly in industries such as finance and supply chain management. They highlighted the potential for DeFi to transform the financial industry and the challenges of regulatory compliance.

In addition to the insightful panel discussions and keynote speeches, the DAO Tokyo conference also featured a range of other activities that highlighted the potential of decentralized tech, including a campaign to mint Kanda Myojin augmented reality NFTs designed to commemorate the conference.

ENS DAO created and distributed “ENS Cards” with near-field communication (NFC) capability to about 120 preregistered event participants. These NFC-enabled “business cards” for the Web3 era served as NFT badges proving participants had met, a function enabled by tapping the card on one’s smartphone. 

It was interesting to watch how at this global event — with 90% of the audience being from outside Japan — the only people exchanging physical business cards were Japanese, symbolizing how the most recent trends come to Japan later than the rest of the globe and highlighting how Japanese society respects its traditions.

When asked why he wanted to participate in the event, Makoto Inoue, a core developer at Ethereum Name Service, noted that ENS was impressed by the vitality of the community at the previous DAO NYC event in New York and wanted to contribute to the success of the first full-fledged DAO event in Asia by sponsoring it.

He also highlighted the potential of DAOs to manage projects such as DeFi and NFTs and said that he hoped more tools would emerge to make participation easier. Inoue noted that the cryptocurrency industry is going through a winter season, but this is an opportunity for new projects to emerge.

Jocelyn Chang, Asia-Pacific growth lead at MakerDAO, told Cointelegraph, “Asia, with many innovative projects and initiatives in the space, has a unique opportunity to play a leading role in shaping the future of DAOs. Participating in a DAO conference in Asia is an important step in promoting adoption, collaboration, diversity and innovation in the development of DAOs in the region.”

Patrick Rawson, co-founder of Curve Labs, told Cointelegraph that the dominance of Western DAOs is set to change as Asia gains momentum in the Web3 space. He said that Asia would become increasingly involved in the Web3 space as Western jurisdictions like the United States face regulatory challenges and Asian developers become increasingly involved in the blockchain and crypto industries.

What’s next?

DAO Tokyo was a reminder of the energy and creativity driving the Web3 industry forward and of Japan’s position at the forefront of this new frontier. With a growing ecosystem of blockchain startups, investors and enthusiasts, Japan is poised to become a major player in the Web3 world.

The Japan Business Federation — also known as Keidanren — recently made a proposal that aims to make Japan a leading Web3 advanced country by 2025 by addressing various issues, such as decentralized data ownership, governance transformation and innovation in various industries.

Keidanren listed three areas Japan could address to become a Web3 advanced country: appropriate tax measures for token ownership, revision of the law on investment business limited liability partnership agreements, and appropriate operation of the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association audit. The federation also proposed measures for NFTs, DAOs and the metaverse.

Japan will host several more large-scale Web3-focused conferences this summer, with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida already confirmed as a speaker at some.

The gamble of crypto airdrop hunting and what it means for blockchain devs

Airdrop hunting can be a lucrative enterprise, but it can also have significant financial risks attached.

In the crypto space, the term “airdrop” refers to the unsolicited distribution of tokens, usually for marketing purposes or as a reward for network participation or contributions.

The first recorded crypto airdrop took place back in 2014 when Auroracoin handed out its native cryptocurrency, AUR.

Another well-known airdrop was that of decentralized exchange Uniswap, which gave its UNI 

UNI

$4.98

 governance token to its users in 2020. In total, over 250,000 accounts received 400 UNI each.

While airdrops may have encouraged some to be more active on blockchain networks, Chris Bradbury, CEO of decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Oasis.app, told Cointelegraph that users have realized how airdrops can be exploited, which has led to the phenomenon of “airdrop hunting.”

Airdrop hunters aim to make money by farming tokens from airdrops, hoping they will become valuable.

One recent example occurred during Arbitrum’s ARB airdrop, with on-chain activity revealing that airdrop hunters consolidated $3.3 million worth of ARB from 1,496 wallets into just two.

We found 2 super airdrop hunters of $ARB.

According to blockchain analysis platform Lookonchain, one wallet received 1.4 million ARB from 866 addresses, worth around $2 million at the time, while another wallet received 933,375 ARB from 630 addresses, worth around $1.38 million.

On March 20, Lookonchain revealed that six specific airdrop hunters had gotten nearly every massive airdrop in crypto.

Bradbury told Cointelegraph that “pro airdrop hunters will use scripts” to consolidate many different addresses into only a handful. “We’re not talking here about someone with thousands of wallets; these will be sophisticated developers to perform multiple actions across many wallets all programmatically,” he said.

A dangerous game

Bradbury further noted that while the tactic has the potential to be profitable once the costs and time involved are subtracted, it comes with some serious financial risks.

“Airdrop hunting is effectively a game,” he said, stating that it requires finding protocols that have not released a token, then interacting with them in all the various ways that could qualify the hunter to earn a portion of the airdrop.

Bradbury added that the risks are even higher when the protocols are new or unproven:

“The nature of retroactive airdrops means you’re often using new protocols, ones that haven’t stood the test of time. And in most cases, you have to deposit your assets into these protocols, adding risk that you could lose your assets to bugs or hacks.”

“The cost of airdrop hunting can quickly outweigh the value of any airdrop if it doesn’t become a top-tier protocol,” he added.

Failing to consider gas fees and other financial costs can also prove to be an issue for hunters.

Airdrop hunting is not an exact science.
We spend many hours, we hope, we get discouraged, we do not see rewards coming, then when it falls, the result is always the same :

— (@0xFastLife) April 15, 2023

Bradbury said it can wind up being tricky to find and complete the tasks required to earn a potential airdrop, as protocols are coming up with more innovative criteria.

“It can lead to losses if you end up doing a lot of things that don’t qualify, and most protocols now try to come up with innovative ways of deciding who gets an allocation — so the chance of spending time and money on something that doesn’t count is getting higher,” Bradbury said.

“You ultimately have to use the protocols, hoping to ‘win’ by performing the right actions on the right protocols but not really knowing exactly what you have to do — like a game,” he added.

Consequences of airdrop hunting

Airdrop hunting has become a relatively common practice in crypto as individuals and groups seek opportunities to receive free tokens and make a profit.

Crypto Twitter has many users offering tips on the best ways to airdrop hunt, sharing protocols that might provide a chance to make a profit and swapping other airdrop-related advice.

Some platforms, such as DeFi analytics platform DefiLlama, even have a page showing projects that don’t yet have a token but might in the future.

Zoe Wei, head of developer relations and marketing at BNB Chain, told Cointelegraph the extent of airdrop hunting can vary depending on the specific airdrop and the measures taken by the project team to mitigate the activity.

She also noted that the practice could create long-term problems for protocols when trying to provide incentives for ecosystem builders and contributors, which are crucial for long-term growth.

“Airdrops are important for the growth of a community from an early stage, but the difficulty lies when identifying the contributors — distinguishing between the real contributors and those who only contribute to get a reward,” Wei said.

According to Bradbury, a protocol’s long-term health is attached to rewarding real users and contributors who are there to help. Failing to recognize this can lead to an exodus as users look for other projects.

“This idea that there might be a generous airdrop and monetary value for using the protocol is actually how protocols get early users and the initial liquidity that they need,” he said.

However, Bradbury added, “The biggest issue is that in most cases, once the airdrop has happened, if you don’t continue to reward the users for using the protocol, many will leave and move to the next project.”

Solutions for stopping airdrop hunters

Determining the identity of the individuals or groups behind airdrop hunting can be challenging due to the opaque nature of blockchain transactions, which can throw a wrench in the works for projects trying to clamp down on the practice.

Wei said that’s one of the main reasons airdrop hunting will likely continue, especially if the projects behind the airdrops do not implement stricter eligibility criteria or adopt measures to discourage airdrop hunting.

However, she noted that there are other options available for protocols, such as exploring alternative token distribution methods or implementing more stringent criteria to ensure a fairer distribution of tokens among participants.

According to Wei, one specific solution could be soulbound tokens (SBT), which are non-transferable and will ensure only genuine supporters receive rewards if projects only airdrop to SBT-holding addresses.

SBTs are digital identity tokens representing a person or entity’s traits, features and achievements and are issued by “souls,” which represent blockchain accounts or wallets.

Wei believes a shift toward using SBTs would also make token distribution more targeted and fairer.

“Adopting the SBT concept can make it more challenging for airdrop hunters, promoting a fairer token distribution and contributing to the ecological prosperity of the ecosystem,” she said.

“It helps ensure that airdrops are primarily directed at genuine supporters and engaged users rather than opportunistic airdrop hunters.”

Wei further argued that decentralized autonomous organizations could enforce governance fairness using SBT tokens for voting to avoid bot spamming.

Another approach could be using randomized distribution methods or limiting the number of tokens distributed per address to prevent disproportionate gains by airdrop hunters.

“Additionally, projects could focus on distributing tokens to their most active and engaged users, by considering factors like participation in the project’s community or usage of its platform, to encourage genuine participation and discourage airdrop hunting,” Wei said.

As crypto exchange Coinbase makes a push toward a sensible regulatory environment for the crypto space, the exchange launched a nonfungible token (NFT) collection to gain the community’s support. However, not everyone is excited about the move, with some not even sure if it will have any impact at all.

On April 25, Coinbase launched an NFT campaign dubbed “Stand With Crypto” after filing a court action that aims to compel the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to answer its rulemaking petition. According to Coinbase, the NFTs represent the community’s stand to protect and promote crypto’s potential and become the symbol for seeking “sensible crypto policy.”

Despite the cause looking like a noble act working in the interest of the crypto community, the reactions to the NFT drop were not all positive. While others praised the move and minted their NFTs, others were a bit critical. 

According to crypto influencer Wendy O, the Digital Currency Traders Alliance “did the same thing,” referring to the push for more crypto-friendly regulation, before Coinbase. The Bitcoin YouTuber urged the exchange to band together instead of being fragmented and include fighting for retail instead of pushing them out.

Meanwhile, a community member expressed their uncertainty about the NFTs having an impact but admitted that it makes them feel like they did something. They tweeted:

Crypto Coin Show host Ashton Addison also criticized the campaign for instructing community members to add a shield emoji next to their Twitter display name while not having one on their own.

At the time of writing, Coinbase’s Stand With Crypto NFTs have gotten considerable support, with over 15,000 mints with more than 7,000 owners according to NFT marketplace OpenSea.

The crypto exchange has constantly been on the move to push pro-crypto policy in the United States. On Feb. 28, Coinbase launched a grassroots campaign to push policy creation that supports the advancement of crypto and Web3. The exchange provided a link for voters to register and view information on the crypto policies of local politicians.

On April 24, the Southern district court of New York held the first jury hearing on the case against former OpenSea product manager Nathaniel Chastain, who’s being accused of insider trading with nonfungible tokens (NFTs).

The allegations were filed by the United States Manhattan Attorney’s Office on May 31, 2022. Chastain is being indicted on two counts — wire fraud and money laundering. On the first count, the former employee of the largest NFT market presumably used his insider knowledge to secretly buy 45 NFTs shortly before their listing to sell them with a profit immediately afterward.

The filing cites several examples of misconduct, such as the case with NFT “The Brawl 2.” In August 2021, through anonymous accounts, Chastain allegedly bought four of them “minutes before” they got featured on OpenSea and sold them within hours with 100% profit.

In October 2022, Chastain’s lawyers unsuccessfully filed a motion to remove “insider trading” references from his charges. Chastain argued the use of “insider trading” to describe his alleged actions is “inflammatory,” as “insider trading” only applies to securities and not to NFTs. Prosecutors responded, noting that the allegation of “insider trading” can be used to reference multiple types of fraud in which someone with non-public knowledge uses it to trade assets.

As the term “insider trading” had previously not been used in reference to cryptocurrencies or NFTs before Chastain’s charges, the outcome of the trial, which is expected to last several weeks, might have a major influence on the legal classification of NFTs.

In 2022, former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer Alma Angotti predicted that the case might see NFTs labeled as securities, as they could be considered one under the Howey test.

In a recent commentary to Reuters, another former employee of the SEC, Philip Moustakis, expressed a similar concern:

“If this case sticks, there is precedent that insider trading theory can be applied to any asset class.”

In another important recent court case, crypto exchange Coinbase supported a motion to dismiss the case on insider trading against the brother of the platform’s former product manager, who’s been allegedly using insider knowledge to trade cryptocurrencies.

Coinbase argues that the SEC had no jurisdiction to file a lawsuit, given the tokens in question do not pass the Howey test.

Romania’s National Institute for Research and Development in Informatics (ICI Bucharest) aims to drive Web3 adoption in the country with the launch of an in-house nonfungible token trading platform.

The institutional NFT platform, dubbed ICI D|Services, will go live on April 26 and aims to create a link between private and public sector institutions and users. The platform is primarily an NFT marketplace, allowing public and institutional users to mint, manage and trade NFTs.

Cointelegraph spoke to ICI Bucharest blockchain laboratory coordinator Paul Niculescu-Mizil Gheorghe to unpack the impetus behind the country’s efforts to adopt Web3-powered technologies.

ICI Bucharest has been primarily focused on research and development over the past five years, but shifted its attention to exploring blockchain, Web3 and nonfungible tokens as the space gained traction around the world.

Gheorghe says that NFTs have gained significant popularity in recent years due to their capability of creating unique and scarce digital assets that can be applied across numerous use cases. This in turn has made them valuable assets for institutions, which led to the proposal of the NFT platform within ICI Bucharest in late 2021.

The institution began developing and implementing the marketplace system’s architecture in partnership with MultiversX midway through 2022, which is the first strategic project using the blockchain infrastructure provider.

The partnership also includes the development of a decentralized Domain Name System (DNS) and top-level domain (TLD) ecosystem, as MultiversX CEO Beniamin Mincu explained in correspondence with Cointelegraph.

Gheorghe, who holds a PhD in blockchain technology and industrial engineering, says the project has been backed by the Romanian government through the secretariat–general as well as the Romanian Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitalization:

“Our institute wants to create a bridge between the young generations and the public institutions values, initiating a comfort zone for the interactions with the digital space.”

The launch of the platform will feature five unique NFT collections developed in collaboration with a handful of prominent Romanian sportspeople, organizations and institutions.

This includes the Romanian Olympic and Sports Committee, 18-year-old 100-meter freestyle swimming world record holder David Popovici, Romanian news agency Agerpres, national philately organization Romfilatelia and Bucharest’s Central University Library.

Related: Fight between crypto and governments “just getting started,” says ShapeShift CEO

Gheorghe believes Romanian government support of innovative projects like ICI D|Services enhance the country’s economic potential by generating new revenue streams and fostering economic growth as well as a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship:

“Blockchain technology increases the efficiency of the institutions, to approach solid use cases based on digital asset management, transparency, security in various institutional operations, such as in education, health, transport, land registration, supply chain management.”

Mincu echoed these sentiments, highlighting the Romanian government’s commitment to embracing technology, fostering new opportunities for user interaction between citizens, businesses and institutions.

Reminiscent of Tamagotchi and Pokémon, the wildly popular digital pets and creatures of the 1990s, CryptoKitties is a blockchain-based game where players can collect, trade and breed digital virtual cats. CryptoKitties was the first Ethereum-based game, and its popularity underscored many of the network’s scaling issues.

This digital cat-breeding blockchain game caused quite a bit of congestion on the Ethereum blockchain, peaking in 2020. However, the game’s creators were able to address these issues.

What is CryptoKitties?

Launched in 2017, CryptoKitties was built by Dapper Labs, the company that uses blockchain technology to bring nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and new forms of digital engagement to fans around the world. CryptoKitties is also considered one of the world’s first-ever blockchain games.

In the game, each one of the digital collectible cats possesses a unique genome that determines its physical traits. Cats can be bred to create new virtual kittens and unlock rare “cattributes” or in-game cat features.

Is CryptoKitties an NFT game? Yes, CryptoKitties are unique, one-of-a-kind assets backed by NFTs, making them rare and valuable. They were built on Ethereum using the ERC-721 token standard, which allowed for the creation of unique NFTs.

CryptoKitties can be sold and traded, and cats with rare traits can fetch high prices. The rarest CryptoKitty of all time is the genesis cat, aptly named “Genesis” because it was the very first CryptoKitty hatched by the game’s creators. Genesis was sold in 2017 for 246.926 Ether 

ETH

$1,854

, or around $119,328 at the time of selling. Ether has since appreciated, and so has the genesis cat.

How does CryptoKitties work?

Blockchain technology remains at the core of this game, but the unique CryptoKitties gameplay can be credited to its Genetic Algorithm (GA). The GA aims to mimic real genetic principles by structuring the smart contract code of each kitten like the DNA of actual living creatures.

Each kitty possesses its own digital genetic pattern, which in turn determines what type of offspring it will produce, in addition to its unique physical traits. This genome is stored in a smart contract, which is self-executing lines of code dependent on predetermined conditions.

Any two CryptoKitties can be bred together and produce offspring with their own distinctive cattributes. The immutable genotype stored in the smart contract likewise determines this new kitty’s phenotype. The GA mixes the code from both CryptoKitties to create new kittens, with the split between the parents varying every time they mate. This allows for unique kittens to be produced each time.

The game’s main premise is that players have to breed and sell their cats, which will allow them to earn ETH, especially for rarer cats. Generation and Cooldown are two crucial features of the game — both are necessary to understand which cats to purchase and breed during the selection process.

First, Generation determines how many generations a kitty is from its original parent. New Generation 0 kitties were released every 15 minutes during the first year of CryptoKitties. These kitties have no offspring yet, so if two Generation 0 kitties breed, they will produce Generation 1 offspring.

The Generation of each offspring is always one number higher than that of its parent from a higher generation. For instance, if a Generation 3 and a Generation 9 breed, their offspring will be Generation 10. This information can be found below each kitty’s photo, abbreviated as “Gen.”

Cooldown refers to a kitty’s breeding pace, such that a kitty with a lower cooldown will have a shorter breeding time. Kitties from higher generations will also have high cooldown rates. Both Generation and Cooldown affect the price of CryptoKitties, as these will determine how desirable they are on the market.

Can you play CryptoKitties on mobile?

Those looking to explore CryptoKitties gameplay on mobile can do so through an HTC mobile phone, which exclusively carries the United States mobile app of CryptoKitties.

Technically, however, players looking for information on how to play CryptoKitties on Android or iOS devices can simply access the mobile version of the website through a mobile browser. However, serious players looking for a dedicated app can currently only do so via an HTC phone.

How to get started with CryptoKitties

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to set up a CryptoKitties account to get started:

1. Create a MetaMask wallet

Players must first have an existing MetaMask wallet or create one. MetaMask will allow users to buy, sell and breed CryptoKitties. Once a wallet has been created, new users can proceed to the CyrptoKitties homepage, where they will be asked to link their MetaMask wallet upon clicking “Start” on the upper right-hand side of the screen.

2. Purchase Ether (ETH)

CryptoKitties can be purchased using Ether, which can, in turn, be bought from cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase. Ether can then be transferred to MetaMask to ensure that players have enough funds to purchase their CryptoKitties.

3. Create a CryptoKitties account

After connecting a user’s MetaMask wallet with CryptoKitties, they will be asked to provide their email address for important updates and key in a nickname they wish to use in-game. Players have the option to go through a basic “Kitten Class” tutorial where they will learn how to breed CryptoKitties.

How to play and earn in CryptoKitties

Once a player has successfully set up their CryptoKitties account, they can start playing the game. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to earn money playing CryptoKitties:

1. Buy CryptoKitties

Players can now view CryptoKitties for sale through the website or secondary NFT marketplaces like OpenSea. Offers can also be made to other players, allowing others to bid on cats even if they aren’t for sale. The owner can choose to decline or accept the offer. Each offer expires after three days.

New players have the option to purchase just one kitty to get started or buy a pair right away. If a player decides to purchase just one CryptoKitty, they can begin breeding it with a Sire from another player. If they purchase two CryptoKitties immediately, they can breed their cats for a much lower fee.

How much are CryptoKitties? Prices vary, but kitties may sell for as low as 0.001 ETH or as high as 600 ETH, maybe even more. Factors such as how rare a particular kitty is and how sought-after its cattributes are can affect the price it will fetch in the market.

2. Breed CryptoKitties

As mentioned, players can breed two of their own kitties together or breed them with a public Sire. It is best to breed kitties coming from the same generation to produce a kitty with a relatively low Generation as well.

To breed one’s own Kitties together, a player simply has to click on a kitty they want to assign as the “Sire” or the father. Then, click the “Breed” button and select “Sire with my Kitties.” Next, the “Dame” or mother cat can be selected to complete the breeding pair. To proceed, click “OK, give them some privacy” to allow the kitties to breed in peace.

To breed one’s Kitty with a public Sire, a player has to select a Sire from the marketplace and select the “Breed Now” option. They can then select a Dame from their own litter to form a breeding pair and then proceed with the option to give the Kitties privacy to breed. As previously mentioned, both options cost minimal fees in ETH, which goes to community-run bots and smart contracts.

3. Sell or Sire CryptoKitties

Once a player has produced new breeds of CryptoKitties, they can be put up for sale or Sired to the public. Each kitty in a litter will have “Sell” and “Breed” options, which will lead to auction pages.

Players can create a Siring auction by clicking “Breed,” which will put their Kitty up for Siring via the Siring market. “Sell” likewise creates an auction, setting the kitty up for sale on the marketplace. The player can select the starting price, ending price and auction duration.

Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) creator Yuga Labs has scored a key victory in its long-running court battle with Ryder Ripps, the co-creator of copycat nonfungible token (NFT) project RR/BAYC.

Yuga Labs initially filed a complaint against Ryder Ripps and his co-founder, Jeremy Cahen, back in July 2022, alleging that the duo had engaged in trademark infringement, false advertising and unfair competition, among other things.

In a pre-trial summary judgment ruling on April 21, the United States District Court for the Central District of California found that Ripps and Cahen had infringed Yuga Lab’s trademarks with their RR/BAYC NFT collection.

The court further ruled that Yuga Labs is entitled to an injunction and damages, the latter of which will be determined at trial.

In a message shared with Cointelegraph, a Yuga Labs spokesperson said:

“In a landmark legal victory for Web3, a federal judge found that Ryder Ripps and Jermey Cahen infringed Yuga Lab’s intellectual property. This isn’t just a win for us, it’s a win for the entire Web3 industry to hold scammers and counterfeiters accountable.”

Ryder Ripps and Jeremy Cahen created RR/BAYC back in May 2022 as a satire and protest against Yuga Labs. The project essentially uses all of the same imagery as the original BAYC NFTs.

Ripps, in particular, is a leading proponent of the conspiracy theory that Yuga Labs purposely designed the BAYC artwork to convey racist caricatures. Additionally, Ripps also asserts that the project’s logo and branding have several nods to certain Nazi symbols and language.

Mandala Metaverse to drop on Polkadot

Upcoming cross-chain augmented reality (AR) game Mandala Metaverse has chosen Polkadot parachain Astar Network to host its first major NFT drop on April 28.

Mandala Metaverse is a story-based project with content spanning TV, graphic novels, gaming and AR. Its gaming elements have been developed in Epic Games’ AAA quality Unreal Engine.

The drop is called “Cryptonauts,” and the NFTs depict various avatars that will serve as playable characters in the game. The artwork was illustrated by comic artist Bruce Zick, who has worked with giants such as Disney and Marvel.

The Polkadot blockchain is not necessarily known for hosting gaming and NFT projects, with the network not even having any recorded sales data on aggregators such as CryptoSlam.

Regarding the decision to take the Cryptonauts NFTs to Polkadot, Mandala Metaverse CEO Jon Shanker noted:

“Polkadot has real future-proof NFT applications, such as nesting, staking and the ability to send NFTs over bridges - plus many other innovative ways to use NFT assets. We can now do things we didn’t think were possible.”
Square Enix partners with Elixir Games

Final Fantasy developer Square Enix has partnered with Web3 infrastructure firm Elixir Games to bring blockchain gaming to the mainstream.

The move was announced on April 19, though specific details on the partnership are still sparse.

Elixir hosts both traditional and Web3 games on its platform and also offers Web3 distribution features for its partnered games, such as NFT sales and marketplaces.

As such, Square Enix will likely take advantage of those features when launching games via Elixir, something the firm has become increasingly interested in doing over the past year or so.

“This partnership brings us closer to Web3 gaming mass adoption. Our team is incredibly excited to bring our technology to work, and we foresee Elixir users playing Web2 and Web3 games alike without distinction,” said Carlos Roldan, Elixir Games’ CEO, as part of the announcement. Roldan added:

“2023 has already seen more industry leaders enter the space with impactful projects, and we anticipate to see more as the year progresses. We’ve put all efforts to ensure we are ready for scalability.”
NFT cricket game on Tezos

A free-to-play multiplayer NFT cricket strategy game called Cricket Stars has been launched on the Tezos blockchain.

The game is being led by Tezos India — an organization that focuses on developing projects on Tezos — in partnership with esports game publisher GoLive Games. Despite the name, however, no licensing deals with actual cricket stars appear to be in place.

Cricket Stars follows a similar model to other sports NFT games, like Sorare, by offering player cards that can be used to have an effect on the game or traded on the marketplace. The game also offers player vs. player modes, knockout tournaments and esports tournaments.

“We understand the power of blockchain technology and its role in the gaming ecosystem. Our partnership with Tezos India is an astounding statement of blockchain technology becoming an integral part of the gaming industry,“ noted GoLive Games founder Ravi Kiran as part of the announcement.

EVENT RECAP
Join us on social networks

From tokenizing investment assets to game avatars, nonfungible tokens (NFTs) have an array of applications that go beyond digital art, with more projects coming online despite the market downturn in 2022.

At the NFT.NYC 2023 conference, Cointelegraph’s team learned first-hand from experts, projects, companies and the NFT community how the technology is shaping the digital world. Check out the highlights of the three-day event below:

NFT games show signs of maturing 

After years of development, the first batch of NFT-based gaming projects are entering the market, paving the way for a world in which real life and games will be blended, companies and developers told Cointelegraph.

“Ten years from now, I could be wearing my VR glasses or still using my phone, or probably using some new system interacting with the metaverse — but I’m going to be able to port my avatar and my NFT items. [...] As a user, I’m going to start collecting more digital goods as NFTs, more than even physical goods, like clothing or watches or cars,“ explained Origin Protocol co-founder Matthew Liu regarding skins being interoperable across platforms.

Alex Connolly, co-founder of Immutable, has noticed an increase in competition in the gaming sector as more projects and developers seek to address blockchain-based challenges, such as interoperability:

“We‘re seeing a few alphas. There’s been a few things that have been playable here at NFT.NYC. Building games is hard. It takes a while [...] to make them good. But I think we’re starting to see some of the best Web3 games that have ever been built. [...] I can own my stuff and trade inside the game. I think that’s really powerful.”

Linus Chung, vice president of product at Origin Protocol, believes that companies trying to bring NFTs into their business should focus on significantly improving one pain point in people’s lives that traditional methods do not solve: “The last bull market has definitely shown that people will go through all of the hoops of acquiring crypto, getting a MetaMask wallet because there is some carrot at the end of that tunnel that’s way better than the traditional way of doing things.”

Real estate NFTs

One real-world application of NFTs is the tokenization of investment assets, and the real estate industry is one of its primary targets, event speakers said. Fintech company Ripple, for example, is working with other businesses developing real estate marketplaces and tokenized NFTs, Emi Yoshikawa, Ripple’s vice president of strategy and operations, told Cointelegraph. 

“Real estate is one of the big focuses of the market that we are very excited about. Obviously, it’s a massive market, but it’s very illiquid and also very inefficient. [...] We are partnering with some companies who are building a marketplace to provide tokenized NFTs for real estate,“ she noted, before adding that Japan is one helping lead the tokenization market in Asia.

A decentralized economy powered by NFTs

Speaking at NFT.NYC, Solon Labs CEO Maxwell Lyman noted that while many projects, blockchains and coins are decentralized, their infrastructure relies on centralized ecosystems, exposing them to security and censorship risks.

“All of these protocols, they’re decentralized on the back end. There are smart contracts live on the Ethereum blockchain or whatever respective blockchain they’re hosted on. But if you look at their front end, they are hosted on centralized servers, an AWS server, or something equivalent,“ explained Lyman, adding: “We are a football field away from getting to a point where the space is actually decentralized.”

NFTs may play a crucial role in achieving real decentralization, according to Lyman. “There’s something that I call global personal capitalism that’s going to be enabled by the proliferation of nonfungible tokens. It’s the capability of anyone in the world to be able to control and monetize their personal information, their activities or their creations.”

Uncertainty about NFT regulation

During the event’s panels, legal experts pointed out that NFTs are facing the same regulatory uncertainty as the broader crypto industry, particularly in the United States, with a major question in the space being whether NFTs can be considered securities.

Katrina Paglia, chief compliance officer of Pantera Capital, said the venture firm is relying on recent enforcement actions from the Securities and Exchange Commission to gauge regulators’ views on digital assets: 

“We do a lot of scrolling of the SEC enforcement actions that have come out recently because with each one of these things, [...] you glean a little bit more information about how they are thinking about applying for the Howey test. Until we actually get the clarity that the industry desperately needs and wants, we’re kind of relying on that for now.”

Subway-themed trading bot makes millions using ‘sandwich’ attacks

The anonymous MEV bot operator’s best day was April 18, where he profited about $950,000.

An anonymous Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) bot operator has cashed in well over $1 million this week by executing “sandwich attacks” against buyers and sellers of two new meme coins.

The wallet address, linked to the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domain “jaredfromsubway.eth,” made $950,000 from the sandwich attacks on April 18 and profited about $300,000 and $400,000 on April 17 and 19, respectively, according to an April 19 tweet from nonfungible token data platform Sealaunch.

The bot’s ENS domain is a likely tongue-in-cheek nod to the popular sandwich chain and its disgraced former spokesperson Jared Fogle.

Over a 24-hour period between April 18 to 19, 7% of all Ethereum gas fees were spent by the MEV bot, Sealaunch explained in a separate post.

A large proportion of the profits came from attacks on trading activity relating to two new meme coins, Pepe (PEPE) and Wojak (WOJAK), which has helped propel jaredfromsubway.eth to the become the largest gas guzzler over the last day and week, crypto researcher Matt Willemsen explained:

A sandwich attack occurs when an attacker “sandwiches” a victim’s transaction between their own two transactions in order to manipulate the price and profit from the user.

This is possible because the victim’s transaction is first sent to the mempool where it waits to be added to the next block. In the meantime, the attacker sets one transaction with a high gas fee — to ensure it is accepted first — and another transaction with a lower gas fee to ensure it is accepted after the victim's transaction.

The attacker profits by buying the victim’s token at a price cheaper than market value, then sells it within the same block — taking in the difference between the revenue from the transaction minus the gas fees.

The large profits pocketed by jaredfromsubway.eth came from nearly $1.2 million being spent on gas fees between April 18 and 19, according to data shared by Thomas Mattimore, head of platform at the Reserve Protocol.

The MEV bot operator has spent over $7 million in gas fees across 180,000 transactions, according to Sealaunch.

While some are finding the humor in the MEV bot’s domain name and actions, not all are happy.

One analyst for on-chain analytics firm Glassnode questioned the “value” of the work jaredfromsubway.eth is providing to the world.

Other Twitter users went one step further, expressing their hatred and frustration toward the MEV bot operator.

According to MEV Blocker, MEV bots have extracted more than $1.38 billion from Ethereum users attempting to trade, provide liquidity and mint NFTs.

Several MEV Block projects have been launched in recent months to help protect Ethereum users from sandwich attacks.

Multiple Silvergate lawsuits over alleged FTX ties combined by judge

Plaintiffs seeking damages from Silvergate’s collapse have joined forces via their respective lawsuits.

A California judge has combined three investor lawsuits against defunct crypto bank Silvergate Bank involving the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX.

On April 19, United States District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley of the Northern District of California ruled that the three lawsuits would be consolidated. Each accuses Silvergate of helping to facilitate investor fraud by the collapsed crypto exchange FTX.

The three cases were brought against Silvergate by four former investors. They will remain separate from other federal cases against FTX and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried but will be combined by mutual agreement of the litigants, according to an April 19 report from Law360.

The order stated:

“The Silvergate cases involve common questions of law and fact, as they name common defendants, arise from the same alleged course of conduct, and assert overlapping causes of action, such that the Silvergate cases are appropriate for consolidation.”

Matson Magleby, Golam Sakline, Nicole Keane, and Sonam Bhatia filed the trio of suits in February.

The plaintiffs allege that Silvergate aided and abetted FTX’s alleged misconduct. Actions included processing illegitimate transfers of FTX customer funds to its sister trading firm Alameda Research.

Silvergate disclosed its plans to “voluntarily liquidate” assets and shut down operations in early March following a bank run. Additionally, the bank was hit with a class-action suit in January for securities law violations.

FTX filed for bankruptcy in November last year and its collapse and the resultant crypto market crash created liquidity problems for Silvergate.

Related: What does the Silvergate collapse mean for crypto?

In a related development, New York state’s financial regulator has said that the collapse of Signature Bank was caused by a run from a broad base of depositors across business sectors, not crypto.

Crypto-friendly Signature Bank was seized by federal regulators in March.

In a House Financial Services Committee hearing on stablecoins on April 18, New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) Superintendent Adrienne Harris said “it is a misnomer that the failure of Signature Bank was related to crypto.”

According to an April 19 Bloomberg report, she said that depositors including wholesale food vendors, fiduciaries, trust accounts and law firms left the bank and caused the run.

Sotheby’s auction house says it will be selling off a digital artwork collection formed as part of collapsed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.

In an April 19 announcement, Sotheby’s said it would auction off nonfungible token, or NFT, artwork assembled as part of 3AC’s digital portfolio in 2021. The firm will begin the auction with sales of seven NFTs that are part of the “grails” collection in May, described as “some of the highest quality and rarest works,” according to Sotheby’s head of digital art, Michael Bouhanna.

Among the pieces being auctioned by Sotheby’s include zombie CryptoPunk #6649 and Autoglyph #187 from Larva Labs as well as Dmitri Cherniak’s artwork “The Golden Goose,” purchased by 3AC co-founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies in August 2021. They paid 1,800 Ether 

ETH

$1,854

 — roughly $5.8 million at the time — for the piece.

Three Arrows was a crypto-friendly hedge fund that went bust amid the 2022 market crash. As part of the proceedings, advisory firm Teneo said in February it planned to sell off 3AC’s digital collection — excluding the firm’s “Starry Night Portfolio” — in an effort to “realize the value of the NFTs for the purposes of the liquidation.”

“From the outset, the Joint Liquidators of Three Arrows Capital have been conducting a thorough process to identify and recover company assets,” Teneo said in a statement to Cointelegraph. “We chose to partner with the Sotheby’s digital art team on the sale of this expansive NFT collection because we believe that they bring a best-in-class approach that will ultimately maximize the value of these assets on behalf of all creditors.”

Davies’ and Zhu’s whereabouts have been largely unknown sin the collapse of 3AC. However, both co-founders have continued to be active on social media channels as Davies risks being held in contempt of U.S. bankruptcy court for failing to answer a subpoena. In April, the pair backed the launch of a new crypto project called Open Exchange.

Sotheby’s was one of the first major auction houses to launch a dedicated marketplace for digital artwork and NFTs in 2021 amid many pieces going for millions of dollars. Among the pieces included in listings on the platform was an NFT of the first tweet from former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, many CryptoPunks and the original manuscript of the book that coined the term “metaverse.”

What happens to NFTs when you die?

Cointelegraph spoke with various professionals to find out what will happen to NFTs when a collector dies. According to Oscar Franklin Tan, the chief legal officer of NFT platform Enjin, smart contracts are flexible enough to transfer NFTs upon the owner’s death, but the death needs a way to be linked to the contract.

Meanwhile, Ajay Prashanth, an executive at NFT insights platform bitsCrunch, echoed Tan’s comments. Prashanth said that setting up smart contracts to automate NFT transfer after death is “technically feasible.” However, it requires connecting to legal documents that certify the death.

The nonfungible token (NFT) market has seen an unprecedented number of new NFT collections introduced in 2022 despite the year-long crypto winter, showing that the turbulent state of the crypto market was not enough to deter NFT creators and collectors. With more than half a million new contracts across Ethereum, Polygon and Avalanche, the NFT market inevitably met with its own set of troubles, with the primary issue being NFT wash trading.

A recent study by AI-powered NFT analytics provider bitsCrunch and Cointelegraph Research titled “BitsCrunch NFT Wash Trade Report for 2022” revealed that over 610,000 new NFT contracts were made during 2022, showing an 860% jump from the previous year. This translated into over 85 million new NFTs, largely thanks to the recent surges in NFT gaming and sports-related collectibles. The total NFT sale volume for 2022 hit $54 billion, with Yuga Labs, the team behind the massively popular Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) collection, enjoying over $4.4 billion in trade volume alone.

However, the hype among collectors and creators attracted unwanted attention from malicious actors, namely wash traders. The bitsCrunch report points out the alarming rise in NFT wash trading activity, which skyrocketed by 25x to almost $33 billion in 2022. Wash trading refers to using fake transactions, copy-minting other creators’ original work and other means in order to artificially pump up the prices for a specific NFT or collection.

Half of Ethereum NFT activity is fraudulent

The bitsCrunch forensic analysis indicates that wash trading accounted for a significant portion of the total NFT trade volumes over the last year. More than half (59%) of the $54 billion volume traded on Ethereum in 2022 is suspected of being wash traded, according to the report. Wash traders even alter the top-10 NFT collection lists when removed from the equation.

After carefully weeding out the wash trading volume, 2022 saw collections like BAYC, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, Otherdeed and Azuki as the top collections by volume. The overall activity across the NFT market clocked at $21.7 billion, the bitsCrunch team found out.

Not excluding wash trade volumes, however, draws a very different landscape for the 2022 NFT market. The overall sales, including wash trading, adds up to over $54 billion while bringing NFT collections such as the Terraforms, Meebits and Dotdotdot into the spotlight as the frontrunners by a wide margin — implying a clear interest by wash traders for certain collections.

Across the top-five NFT marketplaces, LooksRare tops as the most popular hangout for wash traders, with over $26.2 billion or 96% of the $27.3 billion in total NFT sales total suspected as wash trade. The loyalty token offered by LooksRare based on the NFT trade volume comes forth as the culprit, resulting in LooksRare’s monthly volume exceeding OpenSea’s by almost $10 billion. By comparison, the report estimates that out of the $18.7 billion total sales volume of OpenSea, wash trade accounts for about $1 billion.

Two “sharks” washed over $5 billion

LooksRare also became a habitat for “sharks,” or NFT traders who engaged in wash trades of over $1 million in total, as described by the report. Two sharks in particular scored 18% of total wash trading activity on the LooksRare NFT marketplace, coordinating almost $5 billion of wash trading volume.

Over 613,000 new NFT collections launched in 2022. Those that succeeded in making $10,000 or more in sales were no more than 10,000, marking a 1.6% success rate. The highly competitive space makes it essential to conduct extensive research and analysis before investing in NFT collections. While annual reports give a glimpse into the ins and outs of the NFT market, users still need reliable tools for detecting and flagging fraudulent activities. BitsCrunch is working with industry stakeholders to provide a sustainable ecosystem for users and to restore trust in the booming NFT market.

With Web2.5, financial inclusion and economic empowerment are within reach

With the rapid development of decentralized finance and blockchain technology, financial inclusion is closer than ever.

In the late 2000s, the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) unleashed a tsunami of economic turmoil that reverberated around the world. Not only did it shake the deeply-rooted beliefs of centralized finance (CeFi) and institutions, but it also witnessed the demise of banks and businesses as stocks plummeted and international trade took a deadly plunge.

Needless to say, the GFC shed light on the fundamental shortcomings of the existing financial system and further emphasized the need for financial sovereignty. In the wake of this crisis that shook the world, the pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto launched Bitcoin

, the world’s first and original cryptocurrency, providing the opportunity for anyone to access a form of finance outside of CeFi.

Undeniably, the introduction of Bitcoin marked a pivotal turning point for financial inclusion, as it led to the development of decentralized finance (DeFi) and the utilization of blockchain technology. Financial inclusion, a measure of access to and use of financial services is a vital component in driving economic growth and sustainable development around the world. While the number of “unbanked” users has decreased over the past decade, according to the latest data from the World Bank’s Global Findex Database 2021 report, 1.4 billion adults across the world remain unbanked, with more than half living in seven economies.

Historically, the ownership of a bank account has been a key measure of financial inclusion and it remains to be the first step in accessing financial services in traditional finance (TradFi).

Evidently, with the emergence of DeFi, the barriers to entry and access to finance have been significantly reduced. Users can create a digital wallet in seconds without the need for the complex documentation often required to open a bank account, thus further disrupting the TradFi system and improving financial literacy among underserved communities. However, as the industry moves toward the more complex and cutting-edge Web3, there is a growing concern that this shift may not be the most effective solution for promoting financial inclusion, especially for those who are just starting to access financial services as a whole. As the industry grapples with the complexities of Web3, the idea of Web2.5 has emerged as a potential solution.

Web2.5

Web2.5 is an iteration of the internet that represents an intermediate step between Web2 and Web3, which aims to address some of the limitations of Web 2 while avoiding the complexities and uncertainties of Web3. In essence, Web2.5 provides a solution that combines the benefits of TradFi and DeFi. This approach recognizes the value of the centralized infrastructure of Web2 while also leveraging the benefits of decentralization and blockchain technology that are central to Web3.

In the context of DeFi, Web2.5 places great emphasis on the need to harmonize centralized and decentralized finance. As mentioned above, while DeFi has significantly lowered the barriers to entry and access to finance, the transition to Web3 has been accompanied by a steep learning curve and a high level of complexity. Web2.5 is therefore a much-needed stepping stone toward a more accessible and user-friendly financial system.

As a whole, Web2.5 is focused on creating an inclusive and accessible financial system that leverages the best of both worlds, offering a user-friendly experience while also promoting financial sovereignty.

The bottom line

Without a doubt, we have come a long way since Bitcoin’s inception in 2009. However, we still have a long journey ahead of us if we want to bring the world’s unbanked into banking and build an inclusive financial system.

Therefore, it is imperative to continue to explore the Web2.5 innovations that can bridge the gap and provide equitable access to financial services that meet the needs of all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic background or location. Undoubtedly, as we move toward a more digital and decentralized world, financial inclusion will become increasingly important… and it is imminent with the emergence of Web2.5.

A second collection of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) licensing the name and image of former United States President Donald Trump sold out on April 19, one day after its initial launch.

The collection featured 47,000 Trump digital collectibles priced at $99 each, netting over $4.65 million. On the secondary market OpenSea, the “Trump Digital Trading Cards Series 2” collection has since reached 750 Ether 

ETH

$1,854

 in trading volume.

The Trump NFTs utilize the former president’s “name, likeness, and image” under a paid license and are not owned, managed or controlled by either Donald J. Trump or The Trump Organization. Individuals are promised one ticket to attend the Gala Dinner with Trump in South Florida if they purchase 47 Digital Trading Cards or buy 100 cards with crypto. 

According to the FAQ section of website introducing the NFT series:

“These are personal digital collectibles or ‘trading cards’ that you can collect, accumulate, trade, etc. Think of them like traditional baseball or basketball cards but stored digitally so you never have to worry about physical damage.”

The NFTs were available for purchase via credit card or Wrapped Ether (wETH), and users could create a wallet with Torus at checkout if they didn’t already have one to receive the NFT. In addition, users were required to pass Know Your Customer verification even if they paid with crypto to receive the collectibles.

Furthermore, the NFTs are minted on the Polygon blockchain and designed by artist Clark Mitchell. Developers claim each Autographed Card is digitally hand-signed by the former president.

“These Digital Trading Cards are not political and have nothing to do with any political campaign.”

On March 31, a Manhattan grand jury indicted the former U.S. President on over 30 charges related to alleged business fraud. Since then, the price of Trump’s Series 1 NFTs, released in December 2022, surged well above its initial floor price. The former president is campaigning for a non-consecutive second term in the 2024 elections.

NFT app Rebase co-founder denies going ‘rogue’ as alleged in suit by partner

An apparent business partner of Rebase’s co-founder claims that he was pushed out of the firm and funds he owned were moved from a joint crypto wallet.

This article was updated to reflect that Rebase and Edmond Truong deny the claims put forward, in addition to recent comments shared by Krzysztof Gagacki.

Nonfungible token (NFT) project Rebase and its co-founder Edmond Truong has categorically denied accusations made by fellow co-founder and business partner, Krzysztof Gagacki in a recent lawsuit filing.

Claim your wallet ID and do crypto on/off-ramp, effortlessly. Ready, set, XGo!

Gagacki claimed in an April 17 filing that Truong went ""rogue"" by stealing $2 million from a joint crypto wallet and ousted him from the firm.

In total, eight separate claims were made against Truong in a United States District Court in California, including breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, defamation and trademark infringement. Gagacki is now demanding a jury trial.

Gagacki told Cointelegraph that he has shared ""a wealth of evidence"" with the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Attorney's office to support his claims.

In a message to Cointelegraph, Rebase stressed that Gagacki's claims are ""not true and contain misinformation.""

The firm explained that its legal team is now working on finding the root cause of Gagacki's claims, which they say have caused concern to their stakeholders:

""Our legal team is currently investigating the source of the false information and will take appropriate action to protect the interests of our company and our stakeholders.""

""We take our responsibility to maintain the trust and confidence of our clients, employees, and investors very seriously and will not tolerate any misrepresentation of our company or its operations,"" the firm added.

While it is unclear exactly when the professional relationship between the two deteriorated, Gagacki alleged that Truong breached a partnership contract on Oct. 27, 2022, by misappropriating $2 million into a separate wallet owned and controlled by Truong without his consent.

Gagacki claims to own a 50% share of the funds and says Truong refuses to provide him with the private keys to the digital wallet. Truong, in turn, denied the claims when speaking to Cointelegraph.

In the filing, Gagacki claims Troung “ousted” him from the business by presenting himself to third parties as the “sole owner” and “decision maker” for Rebase.

He further alleges that Troung is stating Gagacki is no longer “employed” at the firm after things had “gotten a bit out of hand.” A LinkedIn account owned by Gagacki does not list an employment history at Rebase.

Truong also allegedly “intentionally interfered” with several prospective deals that Gagacki had been working on for the firm in addition to making several defamatory statements to the firm’s business contacts about Gagacki.

Gagacki claims these statements have had a “disastrous effect” on his reputation.

One of the deals involved American celebrity Bella Hadid, who featured in the firm’s Cy-B3lla NFT project but then refused further collaboration after it was made apparent to her that the two business partners clashed heads, the filing claimed.

Truong also allegedly seized a Twitter account relating to Hadid’s NFT collection, which Gagacki claims to have the trademark rights for with his other company, IOVO AG:

“[Truong] has also commandeered the @REBASEgg and @cybellaxyz Twitter accounts. Specifically, [Truong] has changed the password for these accounts and is actively denying Mr. Gagacki access.”

Another claim mentioned by Gagacki was Truong’s unauthorized pursuit to issue a Rebase token on the Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution Arbirtrum.

If a token is issued, there may have serious ramifications for Rebase, the filing explained:

“If a Rebase app token is listed on any major cryptocurrency exchange, the market value of the tokens, which will be minted on the Arbitrum network and offered to the public, could reach many times over the Rebase app’s last round valuation of $150,000,000.”

According to the firm’s Twitter account, Rebase is set to integrate on Arbitrum on April 21:

The firm’s $150 million valuation has come on the back of venture capital funding from Animoca Capital, Anti Fund Investment Fund, LLC, DeFiance Capital and the now-bankrupt Three Arrows Capital.

Despite the court filing, Gagacki told Cointelegraph that he still deeply cares about the Rebase community and wishes ""this action had not become necessary.""

Trump drops series 2 NFT collection ahead of presidential run

Another round of digital nonfungible tokens (NFTs) trading cards dropped bearing the likeness of former United States President Donald Trump, with 38,001 minted on Polygon.

The collection was launched on April 18 at $99 each and had a floor price of 0.0659 Ether (ETH) or $145 at the time of writing, according to data from NFT marketplace OpenSea, racking up a volume of 592 ETH ($1.2 million).

Based on the collections creator fee of 10%, the sales have generated over $100,000, while the initial subscription generated an additional $3.76 million of revenue based on a sale price of $99.

Posting to Instagram, Trump suggested that he kept the price the same as it was for the first series “because I want my fans & supporters to make money, & have fun doing it,” adding:

“I could have raised the price MUCH HIGHER, I believe it still would have sold well, with a lot more money coming to me, but I didn’t choose to do so. I WILL BE GIVEN NO ‘NICE GUY’ CREDIT?”

The initial series, unveiled on Dec. 15, 2022, has seen its floor price drop by 61% in the last 24 hours, according to OpenSea, although the trading volume has increased by 1,011%.

Meta opens Horizon Worlds to teens in a bid for more users

Teens from the U.S. and Canada can now use the virtual reality (VR) app Horizon Worlds after Big Tech firm Meta opened it up on April 18. It was previously restricted to people aged 18 and over.

The decision comes after Horizon Worlds fell well short of its monthly active user goal for 2022, recording an average of just 280,000 over the year compared with the 500,000 it had targeted, according to the data website Statista.

Various advocacy organizations and safety groups have urged Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to halt plans to allow minors into its metaverse. An April 14 open letter argued that Meta should wait for more peer-reviewed research on the potential risks of allowing youths in the metaverse.

The letter claimed minors will face harassment and privacy violations on the VR app, which is still in its early stages.

Meta’s announcement appeared to target the concerns as it focused heavily on ways it plans to mitigate these risks through features such as parental supervision tools, and limiting interactions between teens and adult strangers.

Nike added that it would “introduce other new utilities and benefits” to its virtual creations in the near future.

Smurfs step into Web3 with new NFT collection

Popular cinematic animated franchise The Smurfs are set to launch a new collection of NFTs in association with the Web3 platform, The Smurfs’ Society.

The first public sale for the 12,500-strong NFT collection began on April 18, with 3,000 NFTs depicting various Smurfs characters up for auction with an average bid price of 0.02 ETH ($42).

According to The Smurfs’ Society, the NFTs will allow owners to attend VIP events, get unique rewards and participate in members-only games.

Some of the bidders appear to be either huge fans of the Smurfs or speculate that the prices will increase following the mint, given that the top three bids are for 847 of the NFTs.

Among the more than 250 characters available are Papa Smurf, Brainy Smurf and Smurfette. The collection will have over 350 unique traits, according to The Smurfs’ Society.

Solana saw two positive developments this week with the launch of the Saga Android-based smartphone powered by the Solana blockchain and the retail trading debut of Grayscale Solana Trust shares.

The basic building blocks of DeFi and NFTs in one place - the ABCs of Crypto Report by Cointelegraph Research

The developments, along with bullishness in the broader market, boosted the price of Solana 

SOL

$21

 by 29.05% from April 11 to a monthly high of $26.03.

While the mobile launch positively boosts the Solana ecosystem, the Saga phone appears overpriced at over $1,000 apiece. Nevertheless, the smartphone received positive reviews in user experience and quality.

Independent cryptocurrency investor Amy Wu noted that there are a lot of opportunities for more “Saga-exclusive dApps, games, and rewards as the phone ships globally, which will also make it easier to justify the $1k premium price.” It remains to be seen how the Solana Foundation will lead the marketing efforts for the phone against existing giants like Samsung and Apple.

The Grayscale Solana Trust has only $2.9 million in assets under management — which is low compared to the 24-hour daily trading volume of SOL, which surpassed $500 million — and is unlikely to have an impact on price.

There are also warning signs of lack of growth across on-chain metrics and bullishness across the derivatives market, threatening a steep correction.

NFTs carry the Solana ecosystem

The number of daily transactions on Solana reached a new all-time high in April, showing a consistent uptrend. However, the number of daily active accounts have dipped to new lows, which raises some concerns.

Solana’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem subsided after FTX’s collapse, with significant liquidity drained. The total deposits on Solana DeFi applications are less than $300 million, with Solana knocked out of the top 10 DeFi blockchains by liquidity value locked, per DefiLlama.

DeFi usage across the Solana ecosystem has been limited to liquidity staking protocols, with decentralized exchanges and lending protocols taking a back seat. It appears that nonfungible tokens (NFTs) are carrying the ecosystem.

Solana’s market share in NFT trading rose from 6% to 14% of total NFT sales volume in less than a year by February 2023, according to a Delphi Digital report. It is the second-largest NFT ecosystem after Ethereum.

The report added, “The Solana NFT ecosystem is driven by traders who are more financially incentivized and trade a lot more often compared to Ethereum NFT users.”

However, the NFT trading volumes have declined since February 2023 below the November 2022 level, which is a discouraging sign.

Additionally, the smart money activity has also compressed significantly, with fewer spending and gains made by “smart money” wallets. Nansen tags prolific and active trading addresses as “smart money.”

Solana price action

The open interest (OI) volume for SOL futures, which represents the number of open positions for SOL contracts, surged toward a 2023 high with a spike from $239 million to $365 million in the 48-hours following April 11, according to data from Coinglass.

The rise in SOL’s price coincides with the OI volume surge, suggesting that derivatives volumes are driving the latest uptrend.

The rise in OI volumes also accompanies a surge in the funding rates for perpetual swap contracts, suggesting that leverage traders are bullish on the coin. This is a bearish contrarian signal, as the market usually runs the stops of crowded perpetual orders.

The SOL/USD pair faces resistance from the 50-day exponential moving average at $25.40 and the 2022 breakdown levels around $29.76. The moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) indicator, a momentum indicator, shows a divergence between the price surge and the MACD indicator, hinting at a possible pullback. Support for the pair lies around the $20 level.

The Solana ecosystem’s growth in NFT trading volumes has been impressive, but it has declined since February 2023, and the smart money activity has compressed significantly.

The rise in open interest volumes for SOL futures and funding rates for perpetual swap contracts may suggest that derivatives volumes are driving the latest uptrend. Overall, while Solana has had positive developments, it remains to be seen how the ecosystem will sustain the price growth.

These are the key takeaways from the “2023 Q1 Crypto Industry Report” published by CoinGecko on April 18. BTC emerged as the best-performing asset of Q1 2023, with gains of 72.4%, outperforming the likes of the Nasdaq index and gold, which marked 15.7% and 8.4% gains, respectively.

The report highlights that all major asset classes saw gains through the first quarter of the year, barring crude oil, which dropped by 6.1%. This decline was attributed to United States inflation data, which cited a reduction in oil demand and the ill effects of the U.S. banking crisis.

The wider cryptocurrency markets have enjoyed a quarter of resurgence, with the overall market capitalization reaching $1.2 trillion at the end of Q1. CoinGecko highlights a 48.9%, $406 billion gain from the cryptocurrency market cap of $829 billion at the end of 2022.

The DeFi space was another standout performer, rising by $29.6 billion in value through the first quarter. The report cites the impressive performance of liquid staking governance tokens, which saw a 210% increase in market cap since the start of 2023.

Ethereum’s Shapella upgrade played a major role in driving the increase of capital flows into liquid staking pools, with the network’s upgrade finally unlocking ETH staking reward withdrawals. The report notes that liquid staking is now the third-largest category in the DeFi sector.

While Bitcoin and DeFi have been major movers thus far this year, the top 15 stablecoins saw their market cap drop by $6.2 billion. CoinGecko attributes this 4.5% drop in market cap to the shutdown of Binance USD

 strengthened its position as the largest stablecoin by market cap in 2023, adding $13.6 billion since the start of the year, while USDC and BUSD recorded market cap losses of 26.9% and 54.5%, respectively.

Nonfungible token trading volume has also surged again in 2023, marking a 68% rise from Q4 2022 to $4.5 billion during the first quarter of 2023. NFT marketplace newcomer Blur accounted for the majority of NFT trading volume since its launch in October 2022, accounting for 71.8% of the market share in March 2023.

The importance of building communities cannot be underestimated in the rapidly changing art world, driven by technology and the explosion of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) in the last two years. An audience is a social media following, but a community is a group of people working toward a common goal.

Art market economist and academic Magnus Resch has extensively researched the importance of communities and networks for artists.

Resch holds a Ph.D. in economics and has studied at the University of St. Gallen, the London School of Economics and Harvard. In addition to lecturing at Yale, he has produced several publications about the economics of the art world. He has appeared in academic journals and major publications like The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and Vanity Fair.

Resch recently spoke to Cointelegraph about his latest book, How to Create and Sell NFTs — A Guide for All Artists, which explores the importance of building meaningful communities for artists, and how to create and sell NFTs compatible with their artwork.

Cointelegraph: Dr. Resch, how important is community building for artists in today’s rapidly changing art world?

Magnus Resch: Community in the art world matters for the success of any artist, but being in the right one is even more important. In one of my most recent studies, I looked at thousands of communities in the art world to evaluate their impact on the success of any artist. The results were surprising: 99.9% of artists’ communities don’t have any positive effect on the career of an artist.

These communities — I call them “island networks” — consist of museums, galleries, fellow artists of the same level and fans or supporters. These groups mean well but will never make a real impact at the higher end of the market. Instead, there is only one network that leads to success. For an artist who strives to be successful, the goal must be to become part of it. I call it the “holy land.”

CT: Can you share some key strategies for artists to successfully tap into this one community you call the “Holy Land?”

MR: My study shows the art world is a people business. Who you know matters more than what you make. In the absence of objective criteria that define what “good art” is, the network steps in to decide what good art is and what is not. That is why networking is so vital.

For artists, this means don’t spend all your time in the studio. Go out and meet the right people, at best, those that are part of the holy land. Or put bluntly, artists are on their own and need to accept that they are entrepreneurs running a business. Branding, marketing and self-promotion are essential to their success and are more important than their art. Artists who are waiting to be discovered will fail.

CT: What role do social media and digital platforms play in helping artists connect with their audience and foster a sense of community?

MR: Social media is the most relevant marketing tool for artists. They cannot rely on galleries to do the job, as most galleries are part of island networks and close down after a few years. In fact, one-third of all galleries never make any profit.

Getting into the holy land is hard, as only a few spots per year are available. That’s why building a brand is so important for artists. The easiest way to do this is via social media: 45% of art buyers regard social media as the most important channel to discover and find artists. Visits to offline galleries only follow in second place. I argue any artist serious about making it in the art world needs Instagram.

CT: Has this changed with the rise of NFTs?

MR: Not at all. NFT projects have allowed artists to learn what is required to make it without the gallery support. We have seen that the most important pillar in any NFT project is the community. Failed projects have misinterpreted the community as an “audience.”

An audience is the following on social media. A community is a close circle, a tight-knit and active group of people working toward the same goal. They can assemble on social media, but it goes beyond that. Building a community is about building loyal members who are supportive of an artist’s idea. I believe in the future where artists will give their community voting rights, allow them to participate in projects, and exchange ideas and assets. This is considerably different from today’s audience that just “likes” and follows but doesn’t participate.

CT: Can you share some successful examples of traditional art institutions and galleries that have embraced NFTs and the impact it has had on their businesses?

MR: The biggest winner of the NFT hype were digital artists such as Beeple, Justin Aversano, and Jen Stark. Digital art never played a major role in the art market, being the least popular medium after paintings, sculptures and photography. And then suddenly, some of these digital artists neglected by the market made significant money and sold for record prices. The real impact of NFTs, however, is yet to come. NFTs will be the underlying technology to authenticate every artwork — and not just digital art. This will change how art is traded fundamentally. Without an NFT to prove that the work is real, nobody will buy the painting.

CT: What are the main implications of NFTs on the art market?

MR: So far, there have been none. We are only at the beginning of what’s coming. I predict that NFTs will have a lasting impact, which is fourfold: Artists will exert more control over their work and earn royalties from resales; more collectors will populate the market as it has become more transparent; institutions will find it easier to engage their communities, and give them ownership through participation and involvement in governance. And finally, the art market will become more regulated for the better and thereby increase in value. Clearly, this won’t happen overnight, as changes in the art world take time. We are looking at 5–10 years’ until NFTs become the standard of how artworks are transacted and authenticated.

CT: Can you discuss any common mistakes artists should avoid when entering the NFT space and how they can set themselves up for long-term success?

MR: Most artists will never enter the NFT space as NFTs are not art. And those overpriced, celebrity-endorsed JPEGs that often are associated with NFTs will go away. I don’t even think we will talk about the term “NFTs” five years from now, similarly as we don’t talk about mp3 anymore.

NFTs are the underlying technology that will be used whenever artworks are transacted. In the future, it is not unlikely that the artist will register every painting that leaves a studio on the blockchain. So when it’s traded, the artist not only gets royalties but also knows who the new owner is. This allows them to work more independently and not rely on galleries entirely to promote or authenticate their works. As a consequence, artists will earn more on every piece they sell.

CT: How can collectors effectively determine the value of artwork in today’s dynamic market, particularly with the emergence of NFTs?

MR: Most art is not a good investment. Almost all artists are stuck in island networks and will not see an increase in value. For collectors who are purely interested in making money, they should focus exclusively on artists and galleries who form the population of the holy land. However, if they are interested in collecting art for any other motive (and consider it a cherry on top if the artist increases in value), the whole art market can be their hunting ground.

CT: Has the price transparency and liquidity that NFTs facilitated changed this?

MR: Many of those who bought NFTs as an investment were not able to make a profit with them. They have moved on to other investments. And as the hype faded, the true winners were those who bought works that they liked and wanted to live with. Another phenomenon is visible, too; we are currently seeing the merger of the traditional art market and a few digital artists who had success during the NFT hype. Beeple, Dmitri Cherniak, Tyler Hobbs, Casey Reas, and Artblocks, who exclusively sold on digital platforms like OpenSea and catered to a crypto-native audience, have now started showing their works with established traditional players in the art market, such as Pace Gallery. A representation by Pace Gallery, which is part of the holy land, will help them to manifest their value, even after the hype and their crypto buyers are gone.

CT: If art is not a good investment, why should we buy it?

MR: After having done much data analysis on the art market, one strategy for collecting proven to be the most effective is to buy what you like, as most likely, you will never make any money with the art you buy. I call it “responsible buying” — the notion that buying art is not just an exchange of monetary value but also a philanthropic act. Rather than putting money into an asset, I donate it, knowing that, in all likelihood, I won’t be able to resell the piece. But, by buying it, I am supporting the artist so that she can continue creating art, which inspires her community to continue with this essential form of human creativity. To me, it is a way of doing good, and it comes with an object that I love and a story to tell.

Sotheby’s reboot Glitch digital art sale after addressing diversity concerns

Sotheby’s has announced that bidding for its upcoming digital art sale, “Glitch: Beyond Binary,” will open on April 19. 

Glitch: Beyond Binary is a reboot of last month’s “Natively Digital: Glitch-ism” auction, which was temporarily paused due to criticism over its lack of diversity.

In an April 13 tweet, Sotheby’s announced the art sale, stating that it would “highlight the diverse artist communities that make up Glitch Art.”

In a statement released on the same day, Sotheby’s emphasized that the sale would represent people from all walks of life: 

“These communities do not just identify as male or female but consist of people from every gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation and background.”

Sotheby’s initially paused the sale on March 27 after popular NFT artist Patrick Amadon told his 142,400 followers that he would withdraw his work from Sotheyby’s upcoming “Natively Digital: Glitch-ism” art sale to protest a lack of female representation.

Illuvium newbie uncovers $49,000 NFT

In an April 12 statement, Illivium revealed that a newcomer to its online game Illuvium: Beyond had discovered the rarest Illuvitar yet — the coveted “Holo Blazing Rhamphyre” — and has managed to sell it for an astonishing $49,128.85.

The lucky player found the rare Illuvitar inside a “D1SK,” which is a type of digital loot box containing random illiviators and accessories available for only $32, netting the player a profit of approximately 140,525%.

Ukraine president signs first NFT in collection supporting military

On April 9, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed the country’s first nonfungible token (NFT) in a collection called “UACatsDivision,” featuring cats of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, with all funds donated to the Ukraine military services.

At the time of writing, 3,026 NFT cats had already been purchased out of the 10,000 available.

The play-to-earn (P2E) business model may not be dead, but game publishers and developers are exploring alternatives to replace it, according to a panel at the NFT.NYC 2023. The Cointelegraph team was on the ground in New York to bring exclusive insights from the NFT event.

According to the CEO of gaming platform OP Games, Chase Freo, companies that branded themselves as P2E are shifting their strategy amid the crypto prices downturn. “It’s a model that is not sustainable at all,” he noted, citing Axie Infinity’s shift in some of its flagship titles as an example.

Minoru Yanai from Minto, a Japanese manga and anime design company, said that game companies are now “looking at play and fun, and sometimes earn or swap,” adding that players can still earn tokens and rewards, but publishers and developers are more focused on being sustainable and flexible.

Also speaking at the panel, Paul Flanagan, head of business development at Estonian mobile game developer CM Games, claimed the core problem with P2E models is that it is a “zero-sum.“ “As we all know, most of them are Ponzi schemes, so if you are putting branding sponsorship as a source of money, that might work, but we still need to see that happening,” he said.

Alternatives flourishing in the industry include marketplaces and partnerships that allow players to return tokens to the game ecosystem instead of playing and liquidating them, the panelists noted. “More companies right now are trying to make sure that the game has a really good core loop that enables these players to put back whatever they earn into the game. That’s very challenging [...]. I don’t think play-to-earn is ever going to come back, but there will be variations of how it’s going to look like in the future,” stated Freo.

Speakers on the panel also highlighted that the Web3 gaming industry is seeing more tangible products on the market following years of development. In East Asia, a better regulatory environment allows Web3 gaming companies to raise more funds and seek alternative business models and solutions to improve players’ experience.

Gaming has become one of the most prolific industries impacted by blockchain technology. From in-game transactions to nonfungible tokens (NFTs), the gaming space has taken full advantage of blockchain development. Accounting for almost half of the blockchain activity in early 2023, blockchain gaming is the market’s leading Web3 transformation.

DappRadar’s industry report shows that more than 1.15 million users are actively using their wallets for blockchain gaming, skyrocketing the Web3-gaming-related activities within the space to 7.4 billion transactions. As Web3 gaming becomes a mainstream attraction, investments in the blockchain space are following user interest as well. According to another report, over $7.6 billion was raised by Web3 gaming and metaverse projects in 2022.

The fast-growing environment for Web3 gaming enables projects to blend different aspects of technology and entertainment to get unique results. As NFTs become a core part of the Web3 space, blockchain games are seeking to utilize them in different ways to provide interesting experiences. Maxelium Games, a Norwegian game developer company, aims to act as a bridge between the AAA production quality of the gaming world and the innovation and scalability of Web3.

Viking-Crypto invasion on Web3

The Oslo-based team includes 70 developers in 10 countries working on building a “gamified NFT-minting experience” for players. After years of development, Maxelium Games built Viking Crypto Punks, a Viking-themed NFT minting experience game. Players will have access to the game in the second half 2023, and will be able to customize their characters and make different action choices during the exploration of the storyline taking place in Midgard.

Source: Quantelica

To accompany the game, Maxelium is also launching its first NFT collection, The Pioneers, which will mainly serve as an entry point to Viking Crypto Punks world. Web3 players will embark on a “gamified NFT minting experience” in Viking Crypto Punks, where they can produce over 60 million NFTs during a seven-hour-long minting adventure.

The game will be limited to 2 million copies, and owners of collectibles from The Pioneers NFT sets will get a free copy. On top of the core gaming experience, each license comes with a Quantelica ecosystem decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) token.

A brand new ecosystem for blockchain gamers

Built by Maxelium Games, Quantelica is a technology ecosystem tailored to the needs of Web3 gaming. When launched, it will feature a marketplace, a community, unique NFT collections, play-to-earn games and solid incentives for players. “The platform represents something completely new and appears as a Web3 gaming ecosystem,” said Maxelium Games CEO Elijah Elystrand.

“The Quantelica platform will be able to offer integration of third-party games, innovative software development kits, unique NFT functionalities and will become an important supplier to the modern Web3 gaming industry.”

Elystrand highlighted that Sergey Golubkin, a game producer with an extensive AAA production background, joined the company ranks as the chief operating officer. Golubkin is a well-known name in the video gaming industry, with his portfolio as a producer including AAA video games like Tom Clancy’s The Division, Just Dance and Steep to mention a few.

Konstantin Mortensen, the co-founder and chief community officer of Maxelium Games, shared the current progress on the Quantelica platform: “We expect to engage with a great number of gamers and have already started building a community with like-minded people. In a short period of time, we will kickstart the Quantelica ecosystem with the Pioneers — our first NFT Collection.”

The Web3 gaming company announced that, after three successful funding rounds, it made terms with Morten Klein, CEO of the Norwegian tech and e-commerce investor Klein Group. “I consider this project to be both promising and exciting,” said Klein, explaining that Web3 gaming is within one of Klein Group’s focus areas. “We will be involved as an active owner, both in the future development and in the design of the way forward.”

Upcoming Shapella upgrade fuels liquid staking growth — AMA with Swell

With the upcoming Shapella upgrade, liquid staking derivatives are on the way to turn into the new Alaska gold fields.

The liquid staking sector, with $16.68 billion in TVL, now surpasses DeFi lending and bridges as the second-largest crypto sector according to Defillama data. The upcoming Ethereum Shapella upgrade, scheduled for April 12, has fueled existing interest: Liquid staking tokens, along with Ether 

ETH

$1,854

 itself, see an increase in value as the upgrade date approaches.

The Shapella upgrade technically combines two major modifications: Shanghai, which brings changes to the execution layer, and Capella to the consensus layer. Among other improvements, both updates will allow ETH holders to retrieve their staked ETH and stake additional amounts of ETH without being tied to an indefinite lockup period, as is the case currently.

As one of the consequences, experts expect mass adoption of staking and that Ethereum will remain the largest proof-of-stake network in terms of staked capitalization, although a possible ETH price increase is debatable.

What is liquid staking?

Liquid staking provides crypto users with a wide range of flexibility. It allows them to stake tokens on a blockchain network in order to earn rewards while at the same time maintaining the liquidity of their staked assets. By using liquid staking, token holders can participate in various DeFi activities — lending, borrowing or providing liquidity — without having to unlock or unstake their tokens, as they receive a “receipt” token (liquid staking tokens or LSTs) that represents their staked assets. This provides greater adaptability and maximizes both staking and DeFi activities.

In addition to asset mobility and yield farming, liquid staking provides fast access to funds, inter-chain security, and stability of the underlying network, as it increases the amount of staked capital, which is important for proof-of-stake networks to validate transactions.

New heights in liquid staking on Ethereum

Liquid staking platforms on Ethereum, mainly developed to mitigate the network’s restrictive lock-up and staking conditions, are expected to remain in the spotlight due to providing ETH-staking risk reduction. This may increase the competition between such platforms and force them to innovate and add new useful features for the public.

Such innovations include the reward-bearing token model used by Swell — a noncustodial ETH liquid staking protocol — which is different from rebasing tokens used by other liquid staking platforms.

Swell’s token, swETH, represents ETH staked on Ethereum, including staking rewards. Without changing the number of tokens, its value increases as rewards are earned. It keeps track of the value of the staked ETH and the rewards compared to the original amount of staked ETH.

Swell also plans to contribute to DeFi adoption with vaults. Vaults will allow users to stake ETH and gain swETH to easily access different DeFi strategies with a single click. Vault rewards will be collected in different tokens and can be sold back to the deposit asset and be compounded. Similar to an App Store, the Swell DApp will act as a gateway to multiple income strategies.

AMA with Swell on April 12, 2023

Tune in on April 12 at 10 AM EST for the latest Cointelegraph AMA session with Daniel Dizon, founder of Swell. Find out what will be the impact of the Shapella upgrade on the overall DeFi space, what the future of liquid staking holds, and how Swell takes advantage of liquid staking mechanics.

Once a nonfungible token (NFT) trader dies, their digital collectibles may be forever lost in the blockchain if they do not have a handover plan. Because of this, lawyers believe that it’s best to craft a way to pass on their assets in case of death.

From a legal standpoint, creating an estate plan, which is simply arranging the management and disposal of properties in preparation for future incapacity or death, seems like a good approach. Jaime Herren, a wealth services lawyer, told Cointelegraph that this might be the best step that NFT owners can take to make sure their NFTs are passed on to their loved ones after death. Herren explained that:

“If you have a valuable asset, it is always worth taking steps to ensure it ends up where you want after your death, whether that is to your heirs or to a charity. Substantial crypto assets require planners and fiduciaries with technical knowledge.” 

The attorney also explained that if the right plans are already in place, beneficiaries will not need to take any more affirmative actions. All they need to have is a wallet that will receive and hold the tokens. Herren explained that if the NFT owner dies while a comprehensive plan is in place, the executor or trustee will be the one to ensure that their NFTs will be transferred to the beneficiaries. However, this also requires NFT collectors to give these executors and trustees instructions to access your wallets. 

“Obviously, from the estate planning perspective, the worst thing you can do is hold your blockchain assets in a cold wallet with only a brain key. That is the dreaded situation validating tales of lost permanently lost crypto-fortunes,” Herren added.

According to recent data by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, about 2.7 million Bitcoin

, worth around $76 billion, have not been touched in a decade. Crypto influencer Anthony Pompliano believes that it’s possible that these assets are either being held by disciplined investors or are already forgotten and lost.

Cointelegraph also asked those working in the NFT space if there’s a possibility of automating the transfer of NFTs to specific wallets after death. When asked about this topic, Oscar Franklin Tan, the chief legal officer of NFT platform Enjin, shared that this remains more of a legal than a tech issue. Tan explained that: 

“Smart contracts are certainly flexible enough to transfer NFTs on the death of the owner. However, death in the physical world is not an on-chain event, and the death would have to be linked to the smart contract through an oracle for it to trigger.”

Tan also added that until government death certificates become accessible via blockchain oracles, the death still needs to be linked by a trusted third party, like a lawyer, to verify the death. “An on-chain transfer on death will, in concept, still trigger legal consequences of death, such as inheritance taxes,” he added.

Ajay Prashanth, the head of ecosystem growth at NFT insights platform bitsCrunch, echoed Tan’s comments. Prashanth, who is also a software engineer, said that setting up smart contracts to automatically transfer NFTs after death is “technically feasible.“

However, practical challenges and legal considerations need to be addressed in implementing such a system. He explained that after enlisting the help of legal personnel to verify the proof that the collector passed away, it’s necessary to set up the smart contract to connect with the legal documents.

“The process entails defining beneficiaries in the smart contract code or connecting the smart contract to a different legal document, such as a will, that specifies the desired beneficiaries,” he explained. This will allow the smart contract to find the correct recipients and receive specific instructions on what to do after verifying the death, such as transferring the NFTs.

Asia is “crucial” to the Web3 gaming industry, as it already boasts the majority share of gamers and gaming revenue, and has a high interest in blockchain technology, according to a new report.

An April 13 report from analytics platform DappRadar emphasized the Asian market has over 1.7 billion video game players, accounting for 55% of the world’s tot.

It also houses over half of the global gaming revenue and has long been “the driving force” behind the global gaming industry, according to the report.

Due to these factors, DappRadar claims the Asia region “plays a crucial role in the adoption of blockchain gaming.”

China, Japan and South Korea dominate the gaming industry in Asia and are home to 62 of the world’s top 100 gaming companies by market capitalization.

China has banned crypto and prohibits gaming companies from integrating blockchain technology into their games, DappRadar reported.

Meanwhile, gaming companies in Japan and South Korea are “leading the way in the adoption of blockchain technology in gaming,” the report says, pointing to Sony’s recent NFT-related patents and gaming firm Sega’s announcement of its upcoming blockchain game.

A survey of 1,030 Japanese men and women ranging in age from their 20s to 70s cited in the report revealed a promising outlook for the Japanese blockchain gaming industry.

The Web3 industry on a global scale was also addressed, with the report highlighting that “visual quality and game experience” are “slightly” more important factors for gamers when evaluating a new game over other aspects such as entry price, the number of active users and game economies.

The report also emphasized the significance of airdrops in motivating gamers to try out new games.

It was stated that airdrops are considered “an essential factor,” with gamers still expecting to receive them before starting a new game.

The Uniswap team complained on March 3 that Apple was blocking the app from its stores. But in this new announcement, the team said that its wallet is “out of Apple jail and now live in most countries.”

Uniswap said the new wallet allows users to swap tokens on the Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism networks. It can also be connected to any Ethereum app through WalletConnect. Users can back up their accounts by either writing down their seed phrase or encrypting their key vaults with a password and storing them in iCloud.

The Uniswap app also allows users to see detailed information about nonfungible tokens (NFTs) stored within it, including their floor prices and collections.

To make Web3 onboarding easier, several wallet developers have offered mobile apps with built-in decentralized finance (DeFi) functions over the past few years. In 2020, Argent integrated MakerDAO and other DeFi protocols with its wallet app, and 1inch provided similar integrations in 2021.

Uniswap is Ethereum’s largest decentralized crypto exchange, with over $3.4 billion of total value locked inside of its smart contracts, according to its own analytics page.

Cointelegraph reached out to the Uniswap team for a list of countries where the app is available but was unable to get a response by the time of publication.

Mastercard has been one of several legacy companies rooted in traditional finance to jump into the Web3 space, having been involved in a number of Web3 initiatives in recent years.

Most recently, on April 12, Mastercard announced its new artist accelerator program. However, this time, it added a Web3 twist. The program is nonfungible token (NFT)-gated and therefore only accessible to holders of its Mastercard Music Pass NFT.

According to the announcement, the NFT is limited-edition and free until the end of the month to both musicians and fans. The program was created in collaboration with Polygon and offers free access to educational materials, unique artificial intelligence (AI) tools and other experiences.

Raja Rajamannar, chief marketing and communications officer of Mastercard, said programs like this are in place to help users “better understand and trust how blockchain and digital assets are used.”

“We also believe that Web3 can be a powerful tool in connecting people and building communities around shared universal passions.”

Mastercard highlighted that it has been a long-time supporter and simultaneously an early adopter of Web3 technologies to bring fans and creators more opportunities to create “exclusive, inclusive and scalable experiences.”

Mastercard has already selected five artists from different genres around the globe to participate in the program. In addition to Web3 technologies, the artists will be exposed to a new AI-driven music studio. 

This development from Mastercard comes less than two months after both it and Visa announced that they would be pulling back on all new crypto and blockchain partnerships. The financial service providers said that all new launches would be delayed until improved market conditions are visible, along with a clearer, more established regulatory framework.

 miners have pocketed over $5 million from creating nonfungible tokens (NFT) inscriptions using the Ordinals protocol.

Transaction fees for Ordinals transactions exploded 240% from $1.5 million on March 10 to 5.2 million by April 12, according to Dune Analytics data.

The rise came on the back of a relatively slow period between Feb. 16 and March 10, from $1 million to $1.5 million. Before that, fees hit the $1 million mark within the first four weeks of the Ordinals protocol launching on Jan 21.

Nearly 1.1 million Ordinals have been inscribed on the Bitcoin network, mostly comprising JPEG images and text but also consisting of PDFs, video and audio formats.

Roughly 100 to 500 inscriptions are processed in each Bitcoin block, which usually contains between 2,000 and 3,000 transactions. Block 783,758 on April 3 saw a record 3,785 inscriptions, representing nearly 87% of the entire block.

Reddit’s Gen 3 NFTs plagued by botting claims

Online community platform Reddit launched its third batch (Gen 3) of NFTs on April 12 — a “Futures Realities Collection” of collectible avatars created by over 100 artists.

Reddit explained in its announcement that the artists behind each limited edition Avatar will receive royalties upon each sale, and no cryptocurrency was needed to purchase them.

However, the release didn’t come without issues. Many Reddit users claimed they missed out on the sale because spam bots swooped in almost instantly.

Many also believe the bots were the reason behind Reddit’s NFT shop crashing shortly after launch.

“They didn’t incorporate any type of spam or bot prevention, like a simple captcha. Of course the site got overloaded,” one user wrote, with another remarking there was “no way you guys didn’t even think of stopping bots during this drop.“

Twitter user “Pastel Alpha” tweeted they managed to get “a good amount” of the NFTs “even though the site completely died” and thanked its “bot partners” for helping with its haul.

Reddit previously released a batch of Halloween-themed avatars in October 2022, which was followed by super bowl avatars in February.

Adidas releases first in series of dynamic NFTs

Shoe brand Adidas has released the first leg of its latest dynamic NFT collection, “ALTs by Adidas,” the latest move by the company in its quest to expand its NFT ecosystem.

The dynamic NFTs will evolve based on the decisions and engagement of the owner, according to an announcement on April 11, which described the collection as the “first step” toward owning an “ALTS by Adidas” identity.

The floor price of each Adidas NFT is 0.666 Ether

$1,853

 ($1,275) and has raked in 351 ETH ($672,000) in trading volume so far. There are now 8,989 owners, 56% of them unique.

Be nonfungible, my friend: Bruce Lee enters Web3

An NFT collection commemorating the late kung-fu fighter and movie star Bruce “Little Dragon” Lee has been released by the Bruce Lee Estate in partnership with Shibuya, an NFT-driven video platform.

Plans for the release were revealed on April 11 when Lee’s Twitter account, managed by his family, shared an old video clip of Lee, transforming him into an animated version of himself.

The NFTs sold at a starting price of 0.008 ETH ($15), with 13,907 minted in the first 24 hours, totaling over $205,000, according to its smart contract address on Etherscan.

The NFTs were drawn by artist Emily “pplpleasr” Yang and were designed by Shannon Lee — Bruce Lee’s daughter.

Despite it being an “open edition” collection, collectors can only mint a maximum of 100 of the NFTs.

An NFT trader “fat-fingered” a bid for a free NFT, buying it at 100 Ether ($191,000). The token was part of NFT marketplace OpenSea’s Gemesis NFT collection to commemorate the launch of OpenSea Pro on April 4. Some believe the trader meant to bid the token for $100 instead.

The Web3 space has seen its fair share of exploits in the recent past, with more than $320 million exploited by hackers in the first quarter of 2023. For many users, particularly prospective users, securing their digital assets is a top priority.

A new nonfungible token (NFTs) warranty service from Web3 payment provider Wert and insurtech service Avata is trying to troubleshoot the asset security gap for both active and prospective collectors.

According to the announcement, the opt-in warranty for NFTs will cover up to 90% of the value of the digital assets for any NFTs compromised in a smart contract hack.

Cointelegraph spoke with George Basiladze, the co-founder and CEO of Wert, who said a solution like this helps bridge the “trust” gap, while offering needed protection to an array of collectors.

“[NFT warranties] will provide a sense of security and trust, which will encourage more non-native crypto users to join the Web3 space with minimal risk, making it more appealing to a broader audience.”

The service will be available on nearly 80 digital asset marketplaces, including the KnownOrigin NFT marketplace. According to Basiladze, the NFT protection will be charged at 6% of the asset cost at checkout, and coverage will be calculated by the purchase price rather than the current market value. 

Related: Utility and long-term profits top reasons for NFT purchases: CoinGecko study

Basiladze believes that offering a service that ensures some degree of protection against hacks and theft will help perpetuate mass adoption of NFTs and Web3 technologies in general. 

“Overall, any consumer looking to get into the NFT space wants to protect their money invested and by offering them that sense of security, they are able to engage in Web3 on a deeper level with reduced risk.”

He pointed out that particularly high-value NFTs, similar to traditional collectibles and art, are often bought by serious investors who are more often worried about security than the average collector. Warranties can make the industry “more open to professional collectors and investors.“

A recent study from CoinGecko revealed that 25% of NFT owners have a collection of 51 digital assets or more. Some studies have projected that NFT-related global transactions will skyrocket from 24 million in 2022 to nearly 40 million by 2027.

Tokenization infrastructure provider Tokeny has partnered with Ethereum real-estate tokenization marketplace CoFund, according to an April 11 announcement, in a collaboration that will enable CoFund to issue regulatory-compliant ERC-3643 security tokens on the Polygon

$0.8819

 network to tokenize a $10 million hotel in the Indonesian island resort of Bali.

According to Tokeny, investors can own a piece of the hotel starting with a minimum investment of $1,000. Luc Falempin, CEO of Tokeny, commented:

“Simple ERC-20 tokens and NFTs don’t meet compliance needs. Our technology platform leverages the ERC-3643 token standard to ensure our partners can enforce compliance, even on a permissionless blockchain.”

Giri Kayogiswara, CEO of CoFund, added:

“With Tokeny’s proven platform, we can create a secure and accessible real estate investment market that meets the needs of all types of investors while ensuring compliance. This collaboration takes us one step closer to realizing our vision of a global real estate investment market.”

Tokeny's infrastructure allows issuers to access fully auditable and immutable capitalization tables of securitized tokens directly on the blockchain. It also supports real-time distribution and transfer of tokens to investors.

On Feb. 22, Tokeny facilitated the launch of a tokenized venture capital fund created by the Spanish business podcast Emprendeduros. Investors could participate in the private equity placements with a minimum purchase of 500 euros ($545). Digital fund shares will then be deposited to investors’ digital wallets, with the entire process being digital. Last January, Tokeny received a 5 million euro ($5.45 million) investment led by Inveniam, Apex and K20 Fund. The company is currently headquartered in Luxembourg.

Ronin Network’s native token, RON, recorded 5x gains since the start of the year thanks to the network's plans to shift to a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism and expand its gaming portfolio beyond Axie Infinity.

The gaming-focused layer-2 Ethereum blockchain will change its current proof-of-authority to the DPoS consensus mechanism on April 12.

The previous mechanism had around six to nine participants securing and validating transactions on the network, which put the network at a centralization risk. It was the leading cause of the $650 million hack on the Ronin Network on March 29, 2022.

The new DPoS consensus mechanism allows RON stakers to earn from the network’s fees and vote on the set of validators operating the network.

Additionally, Sky Mavis, the team behind Axie Infinity and the Ronin Network, is also working on expanding the gaming portfolio of the network's portfolio. On March 30, they announced that four new gaming studios are building on the Ronin Network, including Tribes Studio, Bali Games, Directive Games and Bowled.io.

The team also launched a developer portal to attract blockchain game designers to its platform. Sky Mavis aims to become the launchpad for Web3 games, competing with the likes of Immutable and Avalanche subnets.

The team announced the Ronin upgrade to a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus algorithm on August 30, 2021. They rolled out the first testnet of the DPoS chain in January 2023.

RONs committed toward staking currently make up 30% of the token's circulating supply. This is encouraging as the staked tokens are less likely to be sold.

Does RON have room for further upside?

RON price suffered significantly after the hack in March 2022, with its price declining around 90% from $2.10 to lows of $0.22 in a couple of weeks after the attack. Since then, RON has traded below $0.50 throughout the rest of 2022 before surging up almost a year after the incident.

The Ronin team deployed the DPoS consensus mechanism on the network’s testnet on Jan. 5, grabbing the market’s attention, which was evident in its price rise. The RON token also benefited from its listing on the MEXC exchange on Feb. 7.

RON also faces dilution risk due to an upcoming token unlock seeing 4.15% of its total supply going toward the Sky Mavis team and ecosystem funds on April 27.

Technically, buyers have the upper hand as the RON/USD pair broke above the resistance from the February 2023 peak at around $1.01. As the resistance flips to support, buyers will likely target the 2022 breakdown levels at around $2.10.

Additionally, a liquidity mining incentive by the Ronin team launched in January 2023 also pushed the prices of Axie Infinity tokens AXS and SLP. Liquidity providers who paired RON with AXS or SLP received between 12,000 and 25,000 RON, worth around $13,500 to $28,250 at last trading prices.

The Axie Network also witnessed an uptick in usage in January after the launch of land gameplay and new earnings mechanics for players, according to DappRadar. However, the trading volumes have dipped slightly after the land gameplay hype subsided in February.

Per DappRadar data, Axie Infinity is currently the 11th-ranked blockchain game in terms of unique active users in a 30-day time period since March 11. Concerning the total value of NFTs and tokens in the game, Axie is still on top with a balance of $804.9 million.

Utility and long-term profits have been ranked as the top reasons for buying nonfungible tokens (NFTs), according to a survey conducted by CoinGecko and Blockchain Research Lab.

An April 10 CoinGecko report found most considered how much utility an NFT collection offers and the benefits of holding the token before buying, with over 77% of respondents saying using an NFT for its “intended function” had some level of importance out of the 11 listed reasons for buying an NFT.

However, 15.7% responded they were “neutral” about utility, and 6.7% felt it was “not important” in the decision-making process before buying an NFT.

The potential for long-term profits came in as the second most crucial factor, with just over 76% of respondents giving importance to selling their NFTs at a higher price later on. 

Some NFTs have sold for millions in the past, but the market has experienced a severe downturn in step with the broader crypto market. Still, the NFT market is expected to hit $230 billion in value by 2030.

Survey respondents ranked 11 reasons for buying NFTs by importance. Source: CoinGecko

The third most important reason people bought NFTs was to participate as a stakeholder in a decentralized autonomous organization, with 72.9% motivated by the opportunity to gain a stake in such a project.

Other high-ranking reasons included enthusiasm for technology, community involvement and enthusiasm for an NFT collection’s business or artwork.

The reason that ranked as the least important on the list was “disrupting established structures or industries,” which was listed as a top reason for buying by 59.5% of respondents.

Overall, all 11 listed reasons were more heavily rated as having some level of importance rather than being rated neutral or not important.

The results were taken from 343 responses examined by CoinGecko and the Blockchain Research Lab, which were received during a survey conducted from December 2022 to January 2023.

Bitcoin Ordinals community debates fix after inscription validation bug

Currently, over two-thirds of voters on a Twitter poll said the missed inscriptions should be added at a later date instead of there being a retroactive reshuffling.

A few solutions are being discussed to fix a code bug found in the Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,774

-native Ordinals protocol that has prevented over 1,200 inscriptions from being validated.

While nearly every member of the Ordinals community agrees that these inscription requests should be reincluded, the community is debating whether they should be added retroactively or not.

The bug came from the indexer function of the protocol only counting inscriptions that were in the first input of a transaction submitted up to and including version 0.5.1 of the protocol.

One prominent Ordinals member known on Twitter as “Leonidas.og” summarized the pros and cons of each solution in an April 10 tweet, coming a few days after the issue was first made public on April 5 by the GitHub user “veryordinally.”

The first solution involves selecting a block height to retroactively index the so-called “orphan” inscriptions from inscription number 420,285 onwards, which is roughly where the first orphan inscription was identified.

“This feels like the ‘purist’ solution because it means the ordinals protocol would correctly match the logical ordering on-chain,” Leonidas.og explained, despite acknowledging that the reshuffling “may cause other complications.”

The alternative is to not change inscription numbers that have already been validated and to pick a block height to add these orphan inscriptions in at some time in the future, Leonidas.og explained:

“This would not change any existing inscription numbers so the ~1,200 orphans would not be assigned inscription numbers officially in the protocol. It would be up to the market to value them as ‘misprints’ or not.”

Another Ordinals GitHub community member, “Yilak,” argued in favor of not changing up the order because only a fraction of inscription owners have been impacted.

At the time of writing, 67.5% of 1,266 voters are in favor of not changing the inscription numbers, according to a Twitter poll created by Leonidas.og.

On April 8, the number of Bitcoin Ordinals inscriptions surpassed 1 million, according to data from the crypto analytics platform Dune. It came just days after daily new inscriptions hit a record of over 76,300 on April 4.

Ordinals are considered to be digital artifacts on the Bitcoin network, similar to nonfungible tokens. They can compromise of images, PDFs, video or audio formats.

An eclectic display at the 2nd Metaverse Fashion Week

The second edition of Metaverse Fashion Week came with a few technical hiccups — and featured a line-up of big brands, from Dundas to Adidas and HBO.

Inspired by success in 2022 and an impressive list of designers who attended that year’s Metaverse Fashion Week, Decentraland held another event this year from March 28–31. The week’s theme, “Future Heritage,” aimed to connect the next generation of creators with traditional fashion designers.

It’s the second time digital fashion’s core members — including Zero10, DressX and The Fabricant — have participated in MVFW, though the total number of brands declined. There were two shows worth noting: Dundas, which distinguished itself with beautiful avatars last year, and Adidas, which joined this year as a first-time participant. Decentraland and HBO also participated.

Real experience

Attendees this year immediately faced a problem: Neither an iPhone nor an iPad Pro could be used to enter Decentraland. That is, we lost our mobility in the real world. I had to cancel a couple of meetings and stay home.

Moreover, the event’s Mac app didn’t work. So, you had to play the browser version of the game, which didn’t work properly, and you needed to clear your browser cache.

On the first day, there was such an influx of users that it was impossible to even visit the locations, and many users didn’t even see the Dundas show.

Metaverse fashion week or meta market?

In addition to the show on the first day, there was a meditation with Alo Yoga, which had planned activities for each day: yoga, breathing techniques and Reiki practices. It was as if you should have gotten off the computer and done the practice the coach dictated. This was the least obvious collaboration for Metaverse Fashion Week.

Shopping life

The most interesting thing happens in digital boutiques and during fashion weeks in general: Players most want to collect free clothing, which they do 24/7.

The Luxury District featured the big brands, including Dolce & Gabbana, which held a talent contest in which Katya Garnet, Nataliya Grimberg, David Lopez and Dundas prevailed. The biggest boutiques were Tommy Hilfiger and DKNY, which are not luxury brands in the real world.

It’s worth noting that DKNY had a huge four-story boutique with a pizzeria, bar and disco on the roof. It all looked large-scale, but it was very sad. They could at least have put an NPC in it — or even an employee with whom you could interact and buy goods.

Then we went to the failed case of Vivienne Westwood. In the Dear Vivienne location, we could go on a quest in a boutique decorated in branded tartan and a ladder with the letters “SEX.” The miracles ended there.

Adidas had a good boutique and a show as well. In the boutique, you could get a free jacket, which slowed down your entire game if you wore it — but it looked good.

The best location was Coach, which had a presentation of a tabby bag.

You entered through the pink city and climbed into the bag itself, where each day, you could go on new quests, win a boa and try on a bag in Zero10, a partner location.

At the end of the four days of MVFW, participants could visit two DKNY and poker night parties.

Last MVFW, you could attend a Grimes concert, which looked decent and generated a lot of buzz.

It’s worth noting that after the previous MVFW, luxury brands decided not to participate in the metaverse. The focus shifted to the middle, which makes sense — they should understand which audience is playing Decentraland.

Who are they?

After four days in the metaverse, there were many questions: Who are these people who have so much time to load a browser, tolerate bugs and play weird games? Why are they so eager to join the metaverse? Do they want to buy something from Dolce & Gabbana? Or do they want to walk on the red carpet in a Dundas evening dress?

In those four days, it became clear that most players’ goal was to get free clothes.

For now, it does not make sense for luxury brands to participate in these events. Their buyers are busy working in order to have the money they need to buy luxury products — and playing in Decentraland takes a lot of time and effort, leaving little time for work.
